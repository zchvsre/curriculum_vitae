  abstract = {The standard {$\Lambda$} Cold Dark Matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological data. However, there are a few big open questions that make the standard model look like an approximation to a more realistic scenario yet to be found. In this paper, we list a few important goals that need to be addressed in the next decade, taking into account the current discordances between the different cosmological probes, such as the disagreement in the value of the Hubble constant H0, the {$\sigma$}8-S8 tension, and other less statistically significant anomalies. While these discordances can still be in part the result of systematic errors, their persistence after several years of accurate analysis strongly hints at cracks in the standard cosmological scenario and the necessity for new physics or generalisations beyond the standard model. In this paper, we focus on the 5.0 {$\sigma$} tension between the Planck CMB estimate of the Hubble constant H0 and the SH0ES collaboration measurements. After showing the H0 evaluations made from different teams using different methods and geometric calibrations, we list a few interesting new physics models that could alleviate this tension and discuss how the next decade's experiments will be crucial. Moreover, we focus on the tension of the Planck CMB data with weak lensing measurements and redshift surveys, about the value of the matter energy density {$\Omega$}m, and the amplitude or rate of the growth of structure ({$\sigma$}8 , f{$\sigma$}8). We list a few interesting models proposed for alleviating this tension, and we discuss the importance of trying to fit a full array of data with a single model and not just one parameter at a time. Additionally, we present a wide range of other less discussed anomalies at a statistical significance level lower than the H0-S8 tensions which may also constitute hints towards new physics, and we discuss possible generic theoretical approaches that can collectively explain the non-standard nature of these signals. Finally, we give an overview of upgraded experiments and next-generation space missions and facilities on Earth that will be of crucial importance to address all these open questions.},

  abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted ``base {$\Lambda$}CDM'' in this paper). From the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} temperature data combined with \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, \emph{H{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0{$<$}sub/{$>$} = (67.8 {$\pm$} 0.9) km s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}Mpc\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, a matter density parameter {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{m{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.308 {$\pm$} 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with \emph{n{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{s{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 0.968 {$\pm$} 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of \emph{{$\tau<$}i/{$>$} = 0.066 {$\pm$} 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of . These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base {$\Lambda$}CDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} observations with other astrophysical data we find \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3.15 {$\pm$} 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{eff{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to {$\sum$} \emph{m{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{\emph{{$\nu<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | {$\Omega$}\textsubscript{\emph{K{$<$}i/{$><$}sub/{$>$} | {$<$} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base {$\Lambda$}CDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0.002{$<$}sub/{$><$} 0.11, consistent with the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} 2013 results and consistent with the \emph{B{$<$}i/{$>$}-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} (BKP) data. Adding the BKP \emph{B{$<$}i/{$>$}-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of \emph{r{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{0.002{$<$}sub/{$>$} {$<$} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a \emph{V{$<$}i/{$>$}(\emph{{$\varphi<$}i/{$>$}) {$\propto$} \emph{{$\varphi<$}i/{$>$}\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$} potential. The addition of \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to \emph{w{$<$}i/{$>$} = -1.006 {$\pm$} 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} results for base {$\Lambda$}CDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the \emph{Planck{$<$}i/{$>$} CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {We propose a method to measure the ellipticities of dark matter halos using the lens-shear-shear 3-point correlation function. This method is immune to effects of galaxy-halo misalignments that can potentially limit 2-point galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements of halo anisotropy. Using a simple model for the projected mass distributions of dark matter halos, we construct an ellipticity estimator that sums over all possible triangular configurations of the 3-point function. By applying our estimator to halos from N-body simulations, we find that systematic errors in the recovered ellipticity will be at the {$<$}5\% fractional level. We estimate that future imaging surveys like LSST will have sufficient statistics to detect halo ellipticities using 3-point lensing.},

CLMM is designed as a standalone toolkit of building blocks to enable end-to-end analysis pipeline validation for upcoming cluster cosmology analyses such as the ones that will be performed by the LSST-DESC. Its purpose is to serve as a flexible, easy-to-install and easy-to-use interface for both weak lensing simulators and observers and can be applied to real and mock data to study the systematics affecting weak lensing mass reconstruction. At the core of CLMM are routines to model the weak lensing shear signal given the underlying mass distribution of galaxy clusters and a set of data operations to prepare the corresponding data vectors. The theoretical predictions rely on existing software, used as backends in the code, that have been thoroughly tested and cross-checked. Combined, theoretical predictions and data can be used to constrain the mass distribution of galaxy clusters as demonstrated in a suite of example Jupyter Notebooks shipped with the software and also available in the extensive online documentation.},

We find good agreement between predictions from the simulations and current observational estimates of the fraction of mass in the ICL and its radial extension. The stellar mass of the ICL is only \$\textbackslash sim10\textbackslash\%-20\textbackslash\%\$ of the stellar mass in the central galaxy but encodes useful information on the assembly history of the group or cluster. About half the ICL in all our systems is brought in by galaxies in a narrow stellar mass range, \$M\_*=10\^\{10\}-10\^\{11\}\$ \$\textbackslash rm M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. However, the contribution of low-mass galaxies (\$M\_*{$<$}10\^\{10\}\$ \$\textbackslash rm M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$) to the build-up of the ICL varies broadly from system to system, \$\textbackslash sim 5\textbackslash\%-45\textbackslash\%\$, a feature that might be recovered from the observable properties of the ICL at \$z=0\$. At fixed virial mass, systems where the accretion of dwarf galaxies plays an important role have shallower metallicity profiles, less metal content and a lower stellar mass in the ICL than systems where the main contributors are more massive galaxies. We show that intra-cluster GCs are also good tracers of this history, representing a valuable alternative when diffuse light is not detectable.},

  abstract = {The Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) is a three-layered imaging survey aimed at addressing some of the most important outstanding questions in astronomy today, including the nature of dark matter and dark energy. The survey has been awarded 300 nights of observing time at the Subaru Telescope, and it started in 2014 March. This paper presents the first public data release of HSC-SSP. This release includes data taken in the first 1.7 yr of observations (61.5 nights), and each of the Wide, Deep, and UltraDeep layers covers about 108, 26, and 4 square degrees down to depths of i {$\sim$} 26.4, {$\sim$}26.5, and {$\sim$}27.0 mag, respectively (5 {$\sigma$} for point sources). All the layers are observed in five broad bands (grizy), and the Deep and UltraDeep layers are observed in narrow bands as well. We achieve an impressive image quality of 0\{\^''.\}6 in the i band in the Wide layer. We show that we achieve 1\%-2\% point spread function (PSF) photometry (root mean square) both internally and externally (against Pan-STARRS1), and {$\sim$}10 mas and 40 mas internal and external astrometric accuracy, respectively. Both the calibrated images and catalogs are made available to the community through dedicated user interfaces and database servers. In addition to the pipeline products, we also provide value-added products such as photometric redshifts and a collection of public spectroscopic redshifts. Detailed descriptions of all the data can be found online. The data release website is https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp.},

  abstract = {We present Diffstar , a smooth parametric model for the in situ star formation history (SFH) of galaxies. The Diffstar model is distinct from traditional SFH models because it is parametrized directly in terms of basic features of galaxy formation physics. Diffstar includes ingredients for: the halo mass assembly history; the accretion of gas into the dark matter halo; the fraction of gas that is eventually transformed into stars, {$\epsilon$}ms; the time-scale over which this transformation occurs, {$\tau$}cons; and the possibility that some galaxies will experience a quenching event at time tq, and may subsequently experience rejuvenated star formation. We show that our model is sufficiently flexible to describe the average stellar mass histories of galaxies in both the IllustrisTNG (TNG) and UniverseMachine (UM) simulations with an accuracy of \textasciitilde 0.1 dex across most of cosmic time. We use Diffstar to compare TNG to UM in common physical terms, finding that: (i) star formation in UM is less efficient and burstier relative to TNG; (ii) UM galaxies have longer gas consumption time-scales, relative to TNG; (iii) rejuvenated star formation is ubiquitous in UM, whereas quenched TNG galaxies rarely experience sustained rejuvenation; and (iv) in both simulations, the distributions of {$\epsilon$}ms, {$\tau$}cons, and tq share a common characteristic dependence upon halo mass, and present significant correlations with halo assembly history. We conclude with a discussion of how Diffstar can be used in future applications to fit the SEDs of individual observed galaxies, as well as in forward-modelling applications that populate cosmological simulations with synthetic galaxies.},

We review current cosmological results, including contributions to fundamental physics, obtained from observations of galaxy clusters. These results are consistent with and complementary to those from other methods.

  abstract = {In a purely cold dark matter universe, the initial matter power spectrum and its subsequent gravitational growth contain no special mass- or time-scales, and so neither do the emergent population statistics of internal dark matter (DM) halo properties. Using 1.5 million halos from three IllustrisTNG realizations of a LambdaCDM universe, we show that galaxy formation physics drives non-monotonic features ("wiggles") into DM property statistics across six decades in halo mass, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters. We characterize these features by extracting the halo mass-dependent statistics of five DM halo properties -- velocity dispersion, NFW concentration, density- and velocity-space shapes, and formation time -- using kernel-localized linear regression (KLLR). Comparing precise estimates of normalizations, slopes, and covariances between realizations with and without galaxy formation, we find systematic deviations across all mass-scales, with maximum deviations of 25\% at the Milky-Way mass of 1e12 Msun. The mass-dependence of the wiggles is set by the interplay between different cooling and feedback mechanisms, and we discuss its observational implications. The property covariances depend strongly on halo mass and physics treatment, but the correlations are mostly robust. Using multivariate KLLR and interpretable machine learning, we show the halo concentration and velocity-space shape are principal contributors, at different mass, to the velocity dispersion variance. Statistics of mass accretion rate and DM surface pressure energy are provided in an appendix. We publicly release halo property catalogs and KLLR parameters for the TNG runs at twenty epochs up to z = 12.},

We start with the premise that the complex structure of the cosmic web can be described by the sum of its individual components: dark matter, gas, and galaxies, all distributed within spherical haloes with a range of masses. The halo properties are specified through a series of simulation-calibrated ingredients including the halo mass function, non-linear halo bias and a dark matter density profile that can additionally account for the impact of baryon feedback. By incorporating a model of the galaxy halo occupation distribution, the properties of central and satellite galaxies, their non-linear bias and intrinsic alignment can be predicted. Through analytical calculations of spherical collapse in exotic cosmologies, the halo model also provides predictions for non-linear clustering in beyond-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM models. The halo model has been widely used to model observations of a variety of large-scale structure probes, most notably as the primary technique to model the underlying non-linear matter power spectrum. By documenting these varied and often distinct use cases, we seek to further coherent halo model analyses of future multi-tracer observables. This review is accompanied by the release of pyhalomodel: https://github.com/alexander-mead/pyhalomodel , flexible software to conduct a wide range of halo-model calculations.},

The model is developed and tested using synthetic galaxy catalogs generated with the UniverseMachine run on the Multi-Dark Planck 2 N-body simulations. The model decomposes the galaxies around a cluster into three kinematically distinct classes: orbiting, infalling, and interloping galaxies. We demonstrate that: 1) we can statistically distinguish between these three types of galaxies using only projected line-of-sight velocity information; 2) the halo edge radius inferred from the line-of-sight velocity dispersion is an excellent proxy for the three-dimensional halo edge radius; 3) we can accurately recover the full velocity dispersion profile for each of the three populations of galaxies. Importantly, the velocity dispersion profiles of the orbiting and infalling galaxies contain five independent parameters -- three distinct radial scales and two velocity dispersion amplitudes -- each of which is correlated with mass. Thus, the velocity dispersion profile of galaxy clusters has inherent redundancies that allow us to perform nontrivial systematics check from a single data set. We discuss several potential applications of our new model for detecting the edge radius and constraining cosmology and astrophysics using upcoming spectroscopic surveys.},

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of this technique to achieve high precision mass calibration using redMaPPer clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey North Galactic Cap. By including cross-correlations between several richness bins in our analysis we significantly improve the statistical precision of our mass constraints. The amplitude of the mass-richness relation is constrained to 7\% statistical precision. However, the error budget is systematics dominated, reaching an 18\% total error that is dominated by theoretical uncertainty in the bias-mass relation for dark matter halos. We perform a detailed treatment of the effects of assembly bias on our analysis, finding that the contribution of such effects to our parameter uncertainties is somewhat greater than that of measurement noise. We confirm the results from Miyatake et al. (2015) that the clustering amplitude of redMaPPer clusters depends on galaxy concentration, and provide additional evidence in support of this effect being due to some form of assembly bias. The results presented here demonstrate the power of cluster clustering for mass calibration and cosmology provided the current theoretical systematics can be ameliorated.},

  abstract = {Clusters of galaxies gravitationally lens the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, resulting in a distinct imprint in the CMB on arcminute scales. Measurement of this effect offers a promising way to constrain the masses of galaxy clusters, particularly those at high redshift. We use CMB maps from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev\textendash Zel'dovich (SZ) survey to measure the CMB lensing signal around galaxy clusters identified in optical imaging from first year observations of the Dark Energy Survey. The cluster catalogue used in this analysis contains 3697 members with mean redshift of \$\textbackslash bar\{z\} = 0.45\$. We detect lensing of the CMB by the galaxy clusters at 8.1{$\sigma$} significance. Using the measured lensing signal, we constrain the amplitude of the relation between cluster mass and optical richness to roughly \$17\textbackslash,\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm\{per\textbackslash,\textbackslash,cent\}\$ precision, finding good agreement with recent constraints obtained with galaxy lensing. The error budget is dominated by statistical noise but includes significant contributions from systematic biases due to the thermal SZ effect and cluster miscentring.},

  abstract = {We study the bias and scatter in mass measurements of galaxy clusters resulting from fitting a spherically symmetric Navarro, Frenk, \& White model to the reduced tangential shear profile measured in weak-lensing (WL) observations. The reduced shear profiles are generated for {$\approx$}104 cluster-sized halos formed in a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological N-body simulation of a 1 h-1 Gpc box. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the scatter in the WL masses derived using this fitting method has irreducible contributions from the triaxial shapes of cluster-sized halos and uncorrelated large-scale matter projections along the line of sight. Additionally, we find that correlated large-scale structure within several virial radii of clusters contributes a smaller, but nevertheless significant, amount to the scatter. The intrinsic scatter due to these physical sources is {$\approx$}20\% for massive clusters and can be as high as {$\approx$}30\% for group-sized systems. For current, ground-based observations, however, the total scatter should be dominated by shape noise from the background galaxies used to measure the shear. Importantly, we find that WL mass measurements can have a small, {$\approx$}5\%\textendash 10\%, but non-negligible amount of bias. Given that WL measurements of cluster masses are a powerful way to calibrate cluster mass\textendash observable relations for precision cosmological constraints, we strongly emphasize that a robust calibration of the bias requires detailed simulations that include more observational effects than we consider here. Such a calibration exercise needs to be carried out for each specific WL mass estimation method, as the details of the method determine in part the expected scatter and bias. We present an iterative method for estimating mass M500c that can eliminate the bias for analyses of ground-based data.},

Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis results in a robust estimate of the SM-HM relation and its evolution from z=0 to z=4. The shape and evolution are well constrained for z {$<$} 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates; however, failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to errors of similar magnitude in the SM-HM relation for central galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the SM-HM relation to z=4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. These results will provide a powerful tool to inform galaxy evolution models. [Abridged]},

The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named rockstar (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 105 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations ({$>$}1010 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper has shown rockstar to have excellent recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results that demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or substructure average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km s-1 at z = 0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/rockstar.},

For each bin, we model the data as a truncated NFW profile plus a two-halo term, taking into account uncertainties related to concentration and miscentring. From the retrieved estimates of the mean halo masses, we construct the A\textendash M200 and the {$\lambda$}*\textendash M200 relations.

  abstract = {We investigate galaxy bias in the framework of the ``halo occupation distribution'' (HOD), which defines the bias of a population of galaxies by the conditional probability P(N|M) that a dark matter halo of virial mass M contains N galaxies, together with prescriptions that specify the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within halos. By populating the halos of a cosmological N-body simulation using a variety of HOD models, we examine the sensitivity of different galaxy clustering statistics to properties of the HOD. The galaxy correlation function responds to different aspects of P(N|M) on different scales. Obtaining the observed power-law form of {$\xi$}g(r) requires rather specific combinations of HOD parameters, implying a strong constraint on the physics of galaxy formation; the success of numerical and semianalytic models in reproducing this form is entirely nontrivial. Other clustering statistics such as the galaxy-mass correlation function, the bispectrum, the void probability function, the pairwise velocity dispersion, and the group multiplicity function are sensitive to different combinations of HOD parameters and thus provide complementary information about galaxy bias. We outline a strategy for determining the HOD empirically from redshift survey data. This method starts from an assumed cosmological model, but we argue that cosmological and HOD parameters will have nondegenerate effects on galaxy clustering, so that a substantially incorrect cosmological model will not reproduce the observations for any choice of HOD. Empirical determinations of the HOD as a function of galaxy type from the Two-Degree Field (2dF) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift surveys will provide a detailed target for theories of galaxy formation, insight into the origin of galaxy properties, and sharper tests of cosmological models.},

Results are illustrated by detailed comparisons of PT predictions with numerical simulations. The last sections deal with applications to observations. First we review in detail practical estimators of statistics in galaxy catalogs and related errors, including traditional approaches and more recent developments. Then, we consider the effects of the bias between the galaxy distribution and the matter distribution, the treatment of redshift distortions in three-dimensional surveys and of projection effects in angular catalogs, and some applications to weak gravitational lensing.

These methods minimize the ellipticity measurement noise, provide calculable shear uncertainty estimates, and allow removal of systematic contamination by PSF effects to arbitrary precision. Galaxy images and PSFs are expressed as ``Laguerre expansions,'' a two-dimensional generalization of the Edgeworth expansion, making the PSF correction and shape measurement relatively straightforward and computationally efficient.

Since the distribution of galaxy\textendash halo alignments is not known in detail, we test various alignment models, together with different methods of determining the halo shape. In addition to alignment, we examine the interplay of halo mass and shape, and galaxy colour and morphology with the resulting stacked projected halo shape. We find that only in the case where significant numbers of galaxy and halo minor axes are parallel does the stacked, projected halo axis ratio fall below 0.95. When using broader misalignment distributions, such as those found in recent simulations of galaxy formation, the halo ellipticity signal is washed out and would be extremely difficult to measure observationally. It is important to note that the spread in stacked halo axis ratio due to theoretical unknowns (differences between semi-analytic models and between alignment models) are much bigger than any statistical uncertainty. It is na\textasciidieresis\i ve to assume that, simply because cold dark matter ( CDM) predicts aspherical haloes, the stacked projected shape will be elliptical. In fact, there is no robust CDM prediction yet for this procedure, and the interpretation of any such elliptical halo signal from lensing in terms of physical halo properties will be extremely difficult.},

Our sample spans halo masses ranging from dwarf galaxies to rich galaxy clusters. The very large dynamic range of this {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmological simulation enables the distribution of spins and shapes and their variation with halo mass and environment to be characterized with unprecedented precision. We compare results for haloes identified using three different algorithms, and investigate (and remove) biases in the estimate of angular momentum introduced both by the algorithm itself and by numerical effects. We introduce a novel halo definition called the TREE halo, based on the branches of the halo merger trees, which is more appropriate for comparison with real astronomical objects than the traditional `friends-of-friends' and `spherical overdensity' (SO) algorithms. We find that for this many objects, the traditional lognormal function is no longer an adequate description of the distribution, P({$\lambda$}), of the dimensionless spin parameter {$\lambda$}, and we provide a different function that gives a better fit for TREE and SO haloes. The variation in spin with halo mass is weak but detectable, although the trend depends strongly on the halo definition used. For the entire population of haloes, we find median values of {$\lambda$}med = 0.0367-0.0429, depending on the definition of a halo. The haloes exhibit a range of shapes, with a preference for prolateness over oblateness. More-massive haloes tend to be less spherical and more prolate. We find that the more-spherical haloes have less coherent rotation in the median, and those closest to being spherical have a spin independent of mass ({$\lambda$}med \textasciitilde{} 0.033). The most-massive haloes have a spin independent of shape ({$\lambda$}med \textasciitilde{} 0.032). The majority of haloes have their angular momentum vector aligned with their minor axis and perpendicular to their major axis. We find a general trend for higher spin haloes to be more clustered, with a stronger effect for more-massive haloes. For galaxy cluster haloes, this can be larger than a factor of \textasciitilde 2.},

  abstract = {Galaxy intrinsic alignments (IA) are a critical uncertainty for current and future weak lensing measurements. We describe a perturbative expansion of IA, analogous to the treatment of galaxy biasing. From an astrophysical perspective, this model includes the expected large-scale alignment mechanisms for galaxies that are pressure-supported (tidal alignment) and rotation-supported (tidal torquing) as well as the cross-correlation between the two. Alternatively, this expansion can be viewed as an effective model capturing all relevant effects up to the given order. We include terms up to second order in the density and tidal fields and calculate the resulting IA contributions to two-point statistics at one-loop order. For fiducial amplitudes of the IA parameters, we find the quadratic alignment and linear-quadratic cross terms can contribute order-unity corrections to the total intrinsic alignment signal at \$k\textbackslash sim0.1\textbackslash,h\^\{-1\}\{\textbackslash rm Mpc\}\$, depending on the source redshift distribution. These contributions can lead to significant biases on inferred cosmological parameters in Stage IV photometric weak lensing surveys. We perform forecasts for an LSST-like survey, finding that use of the standard "NLA" model for intrinsic alignments cannot remove these large parameter biases, even when allowing for a more general redshift dependence. The model presented here will allow for more accurate and flexible IA treatment in weak lensing and combined probes analyses, and an implementation is made available as part of the public FAST-PT code. The model also provides a more advanced framework for understanding the underlying IA processes and their relationship to fundamental physics.},

  abstract = {The coherent physical alignment of galaxies is an important systematic for gravitational lensing studies as well as a probe of the physical mechanisms involved in galaxy formation and evolution. We develop a formalism for treating this intrinsic alignment (IA) in the context of galaxy-galaxy lensing and present an improved method for measuring IA contamination, which can arise when sources physically associated with the lens are placed behind the lens due to photometric redshift scatter. We apply the technique to recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) measurements of Luminous Red Galaxy lenses and typical ( {$\sim$} L*) source galaxies with photometric redshifts selected from the SDSS imaging data. Compared to previous measurements, this method has the advantage of being fully self-consistent in its treatment of the IA and lensing signals, solving for the two simultaneously. We find an IA signal consistent with zero, placing tight constraints on both the magnitude of the IA effect and its potential contamination to the lensing signal. While these constraints depend on source selection and redshift quality, the method can be applied to any measurement that uses photometric redshifts. We obtain a model-independent upper-limit of roughly 10\% IA contamination for projected separations of rp {$\approx$} 0.1\textendash 10h-1Mpc. With more stringent photo-z cuts and reasonable assumptions about the physics of intrinsic alignments, this upper limit is reduced to 1\textendash 2\%. These limits are well below the statistical error of the current lensing measurements. Our results suggest that IA will not present intractable challenges to the next generation of galaxy-galaxy lensing experiments, and the methods presented here should continue to aid in our understanding of alignment processes and in the removal of IA from the lensing signal.},

  abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing has become a powerful probe of large-scale structure and cosmological parameters. Precision weak lensing measurements require an understanding of the intrinsic alignment of galaxy ellipticities, which can in turn inform models of galaxy formation. It is hypothesized that elliptical galaxies align with the background tidal field and that this alignment mechanism dominates the correlation between ellipticities on cosmological scales (in the absence of lensing). We use recent large-scale structure measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to test this picture with several statistics: (1) the correlation between ellipticity and galaxy overdensity, w\_\{g+\}; (2) the intrinsic alignment auto-correlation functions; (3) the correlation functions of curl-free, E, and divergence-free, B, modes (the latter of which is zero in the linear tidal alignment theory); (4) the alignment correlation function, w\_g(r\_p,theta), a recently developed statistic that generalizes the galaxy correlation function to account for the angle between the galaxy separation vector and the principle axis of ellipticity. We show that recent measurements are largely consistent with the tidal alignment model and discuss dependence on galaxy luminosity. In addition, we show that at linear order the tidal alignment model predicts that the angular dependence of w\_g(r\_p,theta) is simply w\_\{g+\}*cos(2*theta) and that this dependence is consistent with recent measurements. We also study how stochastic nonlinear contributions to galaxy ellipticity impact these statistics. We find that a significant fraction of the observed LRG ellipticity can be explained by alignment with the tidal field on scales {$>\sptilde$}10 h\^-1 Mpc. These considerations are relevant to galaxy formation and evolution.},

We calculate all relevant nonlinear corrections at one-loop order, including effects from nonlinear density evolution, galaxy biasing, and source density weighting. Contributions from density weighting are found to be particularly important and lead to bias dependence of the IA amplitude, even on large scales. This effect may be responsible for much of the luminosity dependence in IA observations. The increase in IA amplitude for more highly biased galaxies reflects their locations in regions with large tidal fields. We also consider the impact of smoothing the tidal field on halo scales. We compare the performance of this consistent nonlinear model in describing the observed alignment of luminous red galaxies with the linear model as well as the frequently used "nonlinear alignment model," finding a significant improvement on small and intermediate scales. We also show that the cross-correlation between density and IA (the "GI" term) can be effectively separated into source alignment and source clustering, and we accurately model the observed alignment down to the one-halo regime using the tidal field from the fully nonlinear halo-matter cross correlation. Inside the one-halo regime, the average alignment of galaxies with density tracers no longer follows the tidal alignment prediction, likely reflecting nonlinear processes that must be considered when modeling IA on these scales. Finally, we discuss tidal alignment in the context of cosmic shear measurements.},

In this paper, we present a method to accelerate cosmological inference using emulators based on Gaussian process regression and neural networks. We iteratively acquire training samples in regions of high posterior probability which enables accurate emulation of data vectors even in high dimensional parameter spaces. We showcase the performance of our emulator with a simulated 3\texttimes 2 point analysis of LSST-Y1 with realistic theoretical and systematics modelling. We show that our emulator leads to high-fidelity posterior contours, with an order of magnitude speed-up. Most importantly, the trained emulator can be re-used for extremely fast impact and optimization studies. We demonstrate this feature by studying baryonic physics effects in LSST-Y1 3\texttimes 2 point analyses where each one of our MCMC runs takes approximately 5 min. This technique enables future cosmological analyses to map out the science return as a function of analysis choices and survey strategy.},

We show that, when real space positions are perfectly known, the cen+N mass has scatter competitive with that of richness-based estimators. However, in redshift space, the cen+N mass suffers less from projection effects in the UniverseMachine model. The cen+N mass is therefore a viable low scatter halo mass estimator, and should be considered an important tool to constrain cosmology with upcoming spectroscopic data from DESI. We analyze the scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass and show that the total stellar mass in a halo is uncorrelated with secondary halo properties, but that the central stellar mass is a function of both halo mass and halo age. This is because central galaxies in older halos have had more time to grow via accretion. If the UniverseMachine model is correct, accurate galaxy-halo modeling of mass selected samples therefore needs to consider halo age in addition to mass.},

We summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and survey design in the context of MaNGA's key science goals and present prototype observations to demonstrate MaNGA's scientific potential. MaNGA employs dithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in diameter from 12'' (19 fibers) to 32'' (127 fibers). Two dual-channel spectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 \AA{} at R \textasciitilde{} 2000. With a typical integration time of 3 hr, MaNGA reaches a target r-band signal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (\AA -1 per 2'' fiber) at 23 AB mag arcsec-2, which is typical for the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies. Targets are selected with M * {$>\sptilde$} 109 M {$\odot$} using SDSS-I redshifts and i-band luminosity to achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, an approximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a wide range of environments. Analysis of our prototype observations demonstrates MaNGA's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formation and quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, and map the composition of stellar populations. MaNGA's spatially resolved spectra will enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies in the coming 6 yr.},

These were identified in the SDSS/DR8 photometric data by the redMaPPer algorithm and split into high- and low-concentration subsamples based on the projected positions of cluster members. We use simplified versions of these procedures to build cluster samples of similar size from the simulation data. These match the observed samples quite well and show similar assembly bias and splashback signals. Previous theoretical work has found the logarithmic slope of halo density profiles to have a well-defined minimum whose depth decreases and whose radius increases with halo concentration. Projected profiles for the observed and simulated cluster samples show trends with concentration which are opposite to these predictions. In addition, for high-concentration clusters the minimum slope occurs at significantly smaller radius than predicted. We show that these discrepancies all reflect confusion between splashback features and features imposed on the profiles by the cluster identification and concentration estimation procedures. The strong apparent assembly bias is not reflected in the three-dimensional distribution of matter around clusters. Rather it is a consequence of the preferential contamination of low-concentration clusters by foreground or background groups.},

  abstract = {The growth of the angular momentum L of protogalaxies induced by tidal torques is reconsidered. We adopt White's formalism and study the evolution of L in Lagrangian coordinates; the motion of the fluid elements is described by the Zel'dovich approximation. We obtain a general expression for the ensemble expectation value of the square of L in terms of the first and second invariant of the inertia tensor of the Lagrangian volume {$\Gamma$} enclosing the collapsing mass of the proto-object. We then specialize the formalism to the particular case in which {$\Gamma$} is centred on a peak of the smoothed Gaussian density field and approximated by an isodensity ellipsoid. The result is the appropriate analytical estimate for the rms angular momentum of peaks to be compared against simulations that make use of the Hoffman-Ribak algorithm to set up a constrained density field that contains a peak with given shape. Extending the work of Heavens \&amp; Peacock, we calculate the joint probability distribution function for several spin parameters and peak mass M using the distribution of peak shapes, for different initial power spectra. The probability distribution for the rms final angular momentum {$\langle$}Lf2{$\rangle$}1/2 on the scales corresponding to common bright galaxies, M{$\approx$} l011 M{$\odot$}, is centred on a value of {$\approx$} 1067 kg m2 s-1, for any cosmologically relevant power spectrum, in line with previous theoretical and observational estimates for Lf. Other astrophysical consequences are discussed. In particular, we find that typical values {$\langle$} {$\lambda$}2 {$\rangle$}1/2 {$\approx$} 0.1 of the dimensionless spin parameter for peaks smoothed on galactic scales and of height v {$\sim$} 1, usually associated with late-type galaxies, may be recovered in the framework of the Gaussian peak formalism. This partially relaxes the importance attributed to dissipative processes in generating such high values of centrifugal support for spiral galaxies. In addition, the values of the specific angular momentum versus mass \textemdash{} as deduced from observations of rotational velocities and photometric radii of spiral galaxies \textemdash{} are well fitted by our theoretical isoprobability contours. In contrast, the observed lower values for the specific angular momentum for ellipticals of the same mass cannot be accounted for within our linear-regime investigation, highlighting the importance of strongly non-linear phenomena to explain the spin of such objects.},

If the orientation of the galaxy image is determined either by the angular momentum or the shape of the halo in which it forms, then the image should be aligned preferentially with the component of the tidal gravitational field perpendicular to the line of sight. Long-range correlations in the tidal field will thus lead to long-range ellipticity-ellipticity correlations that mimic the shear correlations due to weak gravitational lensing. We calculate the ellipticity-ellipticity correlation expected if halo shapes determine the observed galaxy shape, and we discuss uncertainties (which are still considerable) in the predicted amplitude of this correlation. The ellipticity-ellipticity correlation induced by angular momenta should be smaller. We consider several methods for discriminating between the weak-lensing (extrinsic) and intrinsic correlations, including the use of redshift information. An ellipticity--tidal-field correlation also implies the existence of an alignment of images of galaxies near clusters. Although the intrinsic alignment may complicate the interpretation of field-lensing results, it is inherently interesting as it may shed light on galaxy formation as well as on structure formation.},

Using results from two very large cosmological N-body simulations, which increase the available volume at their mass resolution by roughly two orders of magnitude, we robustly determine the halo concentration\textendash mass (c-M) relation over a wide range of masses, employing multiple methods of concentration measurement. We characterize individual halo profiles, as well as stacked profiles, relevant for galaxy\textendash galaxy lensing and next-generation cluster surveys; the redshift range covered is 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 4, with a minimum halo mass of M200c {$\sim$} 2 \texttimes{} 1011 M{$\odot$}. Despite the complexity of a proper description of a halo (environmental effects, merger history, nonsphericity, relaxation state), when the mass is scaled by the nonlinear mass scale M{$\star$}(z), we find that a simple non-power-law form for the c\textendash M/M{$\star$} relation provides an excellent description of our simulation results across eight decades in M/M{$\star$} and for 0 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 4. Over the mass range covered, the c\textendash M relation has two asymptotic forms: an approximate power law below a mass threshold M/M{$\star$} {$\sim$} 500\textendash 1000, transitioning to a constant value, c0 {$\sim$} 3 at higher masses. The relaxed halo fraction decreases with mass, transitioning to a constant value of {$\sim$}0.5 above the same mass threshold. We compare Navarro\textendash Frenk\textendash White (NFW) and Einasto fits to stacked profiles in narrow mass bins at different redshifts; as expected, the Einasto profile provides a better description of the simulation results. At cluster scales at low redshift, however, both NFW and Einasto profiles are in very good agreement with the simulation results, consistent with recent weak lensing observations.},

  abstract = {We present the first cosmological study of a sample of eROSITA clusters, which were identified in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS). In a joint selection on X-ray and optical observables, the sample contains 455 clusters within a redshift range of 0.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.2, of which 177 systems are covered by the public data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey that enables uniform weak-lensing cluster mass constraints. With minimal assumptions, at each cluster redshift we empirically model (1) the scaling relations between the cluster halo mass and the observables, which include the X-ray count rate, the optical richness, and the weak-lensing mass, and (2) the X-ray selection in terms of the completeness function \$\textbackslash mathcal \{C\}\$. Using the richness distribution of the clusters, we directly measure the X-ray completeness and adopt those measurements as informative priors for the parameters of \$\textbackslash mathcal \{C\}\$. In a blinded analysis, we obtain the cosmological constraints \$\textbackslash Omega \_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\}= 0.245\^\{+0.048\}\_\{-0.058\}\$, \$\textbackslash sigma \_\{8\}= 0.833\^\{+0.075\}\_\{-0.063\}\$, and \$S\_\{8\}\textbackslash equiv \textbackslash sigma \_\{8\}\textbackslash left(\textbackslash Omega \_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\}/0.3\textbackslash right)\^\{0.3\}= 0.791\^\{+0.028\}\_\{-0.031\}\$ in a flat {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology. Extending to a flat wCDM cosmology leads to the constraint on the equation of state parameter of the dark energy of w = -1.25 {$\pm$} 0.47. The eFEDS constraints are in good agreement with the results from the Planck mission, the galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering analysis of the Dark Energy Survey, and the cluster abundance analysis of the SPT-SZ survey at a level of {$\lessequivlnt$} 1{$\sigma$}. With the empirical modelling, this work presents the first fully self-consistent cosmological constraints based on a synergy between wide-field X-ray and weak lensing surveys.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological results from a combined analysis of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing, using 1321 deg\$\^2\$ of \$griz\$ imaging data from the first year of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y1). We combine three two-point functions: (i) the cosmic shear correlation function of 26 million source galaxies in four redshift bins, (ii) the galaxy angular autocorrelation function of 650,000 luminous red galaxies in five redshift bins, and (iii) the galaxy-shear cross-correlation of luminous red galaxy positions and source galaxy shears. To demonstrate the robustness of these results, we use independent pairs of galaxy shape, photometric redshift estimation and validation, and likelihood analysis pipelines. To prevent confirmation bias, the bulk of the analysis was carried out while blind to the true results; we describe an extensive suite of systematics checks performed and passed during this blinded phase. The data are modeled in flat \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM and \$w\$CDM cosmologies, marginalizing over 20 nuisance parameters, varying 6 (for \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM) or 7 (for \$w\$CDM) cosmological parameters including the neutrino mass density and including the 457 \$\textbackslash times\$ 457 element analytic covariance matrix. We find consistent cosmological results from these three two-point functions, and from their combination obtain \$S\_8 \textbackslash equiv \textbackslash sigma\_8 (\textbackslash Omega\_m/0.3)\^\{0.5\} = 0.783\^\{+0.021\}\_\{-0.025\}\$ and \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.264\^\{+0.032\}\_\{-0.019\}\$ for \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM for \$w\$CDM, we find \$S\_8 = 0.794\^\{+0.029\}\_\{-0.027\}\$, \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.279\^\{+0.043\}\_\{-0.022\}\$, and \$w=-0.80\^\{+0.20\}\_\{-0.22\}\$ at 68\% CL. The precision of these DES Y1 results rivals that from the Planck cosmic microwave background measurements, allowing a comparison of structure in the very early and late Universe on equal terms. Although the DES Y1 best-fit values for \$S\_8\$ and \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$ are lower than the central values from Planck ...},

  abstract = {A major problem in extragalactic astronomy is the inability to distinguish in a robust, physical, and model-independent way how galaxy populations are physically related to each other and to their formation histories. A similar, but distinct, and also long-standing question is whether the structural appearances of galaxies, as seen through their stellar light distributions, contain enough physical information to offer this classification. We argue through the use of 240 images of nearby galaxies that three model-independent parameters measured on a single galaxy image reveal its major ongoing and past formation modes and can be used as a robust classification system. These parameters quantitatively measure: the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S) of a galaxy's stellar light distribution. When combined into a three-dimensional ``CAS'' volume all major classes of galaxies in various phases of evolution are cleanly distinguished. We argue that these three parameters correlate with important modes of galaxy evolution: star formation and major merging activity. This is argued through the strong correlation of H{$\alpha$} equivalent width and broadband colors with the clumpiness parameter S, the uniquely large asymmetries of 66 galaxies undergoing mergers, and the correlation of bulge to total light ratios, and stellar masses, with the concentration index. As an obvious goal is to use this system at high redshifts to trace evolution, we demonstrate that these parameters can be measured, within a reasonable and quantifiable uncertainty with available data out to z\textasciitilde 3 using the Hubble Space Telescope GOODS ACS and Hubble Deep Field images.},

We first describe the model, and demonstrate its accuracy by comparing its predictions with exact results from numerical simulations of nonlinear gravitational clustering. We then present several astrophysical applications of the halo model: these include models of the spatial distribution of galaxies, the nonlinear velocity, momentum and pressure fields, descriptions of weak gravitational lensing, and estimates of secondary contributions to temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background.},

  abstract = {We perform a joint analysis of the counts of redMaPPer clusters selected from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 data and multi-wavelength follow-up data collected within the 2500 deg\$\^2\$ South Pole Telescope (SPT) SZ survey. The SPT follow-up data, calibrating the richness--mass relation of the optically selected redMaPPer catalog, enable the cosmological exploitation of the DES cluster abundance data. To explore possible systematics related to the modeling of projection effects, we consider two calibrations of the observational scatter on richness estimates: a simple Gaussian model which account only for the background contamination (BKG), and a model which further includes contamination and incompleteness due to projection effects (PRJ). Assuming either a \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM+\$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu\$ or \$w\$CDM+\$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu\$ cosmology, and for both scatter models, we derive cosmological constraints consistent with multiple cosmological probes of the low and high redshift Universe, and in particular with the SPT cluster abundance data. This result demonstrates that the DES Y1 and SPT cluster counts provide consistent cosmological constraints, if the same mass calibration data set is adopted. It thus supports the conclusion of the DES Y1 cluster cosmology analysis which interprets the tension observed with other cosmological probes in terms of systematics affecting the stacked weak lensing analysis of optically--selected low--richness clusters. Finally, we analyse the first combined optically-SZ selected cluster catalogue obtained by including the SPT sample above the maximum redshift probed by the DES Y1 redMaPPer sample. Besides providing a mild improvement of the cosmological constraints, this data combination serves as a stricter test of our scatter models: the PRJ model, providing scaling relations consistent between the two abundance and multi-wavelength follow-up data, is favored over the BKG model.},

  abstract = {We implement the first blind analysis of cluster abundance data to derive cosmological constraints from the abundance and weak lensing signal of redMaPPer clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We simultaneously fit for cosmological parameters and the richness-mass relation of the clusters. For a flat {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmological model with massive neutrinos, we find S\_8 {$\equiv$} {$\sigma$} 8({$\Omega$} \_ m/0.3)\^\{0.5\}=0.79\^\{+0.05\}\_\{-0.04\}. This value is both consistent and competitive with that derived from cluster catalogues selected in different wavelengths. Our result is also consistent with the combined probes analyses by the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies as measured by Planck. We demonstrate that the cosmological posteriors are robust against variation of the richness-mass relation model and to systematics associated with the calibration of the selection function. In combination with baryon acoustic oscillation data and big bang nucleosynthesis data (Cooke et al.), we constrain the Hubble rate to be h = 0.66 {$\pm$} 0.02, independent of the CMB. Future work aimed at improving our understanding of the scatter of the richness-mass relation has the potential to significantly improve the precision of our cosmological posteriors. The methods described in this work were developed for use in the forthcoming analysis of cluster abundances in the DES. Our SDSS analysis constitutes the first part of a staged-unblinding analysis of the full DES data set.},

Projection effects are a particularly pernicious systematic effect that can impact observable mass proxies; structure along the line of sight can both bias and increase the scatter of the observable mass proxies used in cluster abundance studies. In this work, we develop an empirical method to characterize the impact of projection effects on redMaPPer cluster catalogues. We use numerical simulations to validate our method and illustrate its robustness. We demonstrate that modeling of projection effects is a necessary component for cluster abundance studies capable of reaching \$\textbackslash approx 5\textbackslash\%\$ mass calibration uncertainties (e.g. the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 sample). Specifically, ignoring the impact of projection effects in the observable--mass relation --- i.e. marginalizing over a log-normal model only --- biases the posterior of the cluster normalization condition \$S\_8 \textbackslash equiv \textbackslash sigma\_8 (\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm m\}/0.3)\^\{1/2\}\$ by \$\textbackslash Delta S\_8 =0.05\$, more than twice the uncertainty in the posterior for such an analysis.},

  abstract = {The Hubble constant, H0, or its dimensionless equivalent, "little h", is a fundamental cosmological property that is now known to an accuracy better than a few percent. Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a "cheat sheet" of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis.},

Here we present the data set and study the differences to observations for fundamental galaxy cluster properties and scaling relations. We find that the modelled galaxy clusters are generally in reasonable agreement with observations with respect to baryonic fractions and gas scaling relations at redshift z = 0. However, there are still some (model-dependent) differences, such as central galaxies being too massive, and galaxy colours (g - r) being bluer (about 0.2 dex lower at the peak position) than in observations. The agreement in gas scaling relations down to 10\^\{13\} h\^\{-1\} M\_\{{$\odot\rbrace$} between the simulations indicates that particulars of the sub-grid modelling of the baryonic physics only has a weak influence on these relations. We also include - where appropriate - a comparison to three semi-analytical galaxy formation models as applied to the same underlying dark-matter-only simulation.

  abstract = {It is well-known that a galaxy's environment has a fundamental influence in shaping its properties. We study the environmental effects on galaxy evolution, with an emphasis on the environment defined as the local number density of galaxies. The density field is estimated with different estimators (weighted adaptive kernel smoothing, 10th and 5th nearest neighbors, Voronoi and Delaunay tessellation) for a Ks {$<$} 24 sample of {$\sim$}190,000 galaxies in the COSMOS field at 0.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3.1. The performance of each estimator is evaluated with extensive simulations. We show that overall there is a good agreement between the estimated density fields using different methods over {$\sim$}2 dex in overdensity values. However, our simulations show that adaptive kernel and Voronoi tessellation outperform other methods. Using the Voronoi tessellation method, we assign surface densities to a mass complete sample of quiescent and star-forming galaxies out to z {$\sim$} 3. We show that at a fixed stellar mass, the median color of quiescent galaxies does not depend on their host environment out to z {$\sim$} 3. We find that the number and stellar mass density of massive ({$>$}1011 \{\{M\}{$\odot$} \}) star-forming galaxies have not significantly changed since z {$\sim$} 3, regardless of their environment. However, for massive quiescent systems at lower redshifts (z {$\lessequivlnt$} 1.3), we find a significant evolution in the number and stellar mass densities in denser environments compared to lower density regions. Our results suggest that the relation between stellar mass and local density is more fundamental than the color-density relation and that environment plays a significant role in quenching star-formation activity in galaxies at z {$\lessequivlnt$} 1.},

  abstract = {We quantify two main pathways through which baryonic physics biases cluster count cosmology. We create mock cluster samples that reproduce the baryon content inferred from X-ray observations. We link clusters to their counterparts in a dark matter-only universe, whose abundances can be predicted robustly, by assuming the dark matter density profile is not significantly affected by baryons. We derive weak lensing halo masses and infer the best-fitting cosmological parameters \$\textbackslash Omega\_\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\$, \$S\_8=\textbackslash sigma\_8(\textbackslash Omega\_\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}/0.3)\^\{0.2\}\$, and \$w\_0\$ from the mock cluster sample. We find that because of the need to accommodate the change in the density profile due to the ejection of baryons, weak lensing mass calibrations are only unbiased if the concentration is left free when fitting the reduced shear with NFW profiles. However, even unbiased total mass estimates give rise to biased cosmological parameters if the measured mass functions are compared with predictions from dark matter-only simulations. This bias dominates for haloes with \$m\_\textbackslash mathrm\{500c\} {$<$} 10\^\{14.5\} \textbackslash, h\^\{-1\} \textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$. For a stage IV-like cluster survey without mass estimation uncertainties, an area \$\textbackslash approx 15000 \textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{deg\^2\}\$ and a constant mass cut of \$m\_\textbackslash mathrm\{200m,min\} = 10\^\{14\} \textbackslash, h\^\{-1\} \textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$, the biases are \$-11 \textbackslash pm 1 \textbackslash, \textbackslash\%\$ in \$\textbackslash Omega\_\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\$, \$-3.29 \textbackslash pm 0.04 \textbackslash, \textbackslash\%\$ in \$S\_8\$, and \$9 \textbackslash pm 1.5 \textbackslash, \textbackslash\%\$ in \$w\_0\$. The statistical significance of the baryonic bias depends on how accurately the actual uncertainty on individual cluster mass estimates is known. We suggest that rather than the total halo mass, the (re-scaled) dark matter mass inferred from the combination of weak lensing and observations of the hot gas, should be used for cluster count cosmology.},

We develop a criterion for clump survival, with or without their gas, based on a predictive survivability parameter \$S\$. It compares the energy sources by supernova feedback and gravitational contraction to the clump binding energy and losses by outflows and turbulence dissipation. The clump properties are derived from Toomre instability, approaching virial and Jeans equilibrium, and the supernova energy deposit is based on an up-to-date bubble analysis. For moderate feedback levels, we find that L clumps exist with circular velocities \$\textbackslash sim\textbackslash!50\textbackslash, km\textbackslash, s\^\{-1\}\$ and masses \$\textbackslash geq\textbackslash!10\^8\textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$. They are likely in galaxies with circular velocities \$\textbackslash geq \textbackslash!200\textbackslash, km\textbackslash, s\^\{-1\}\$, consistent at \$z \textbackslash sim 2\$ with the favored stellar mass for discs, \$\textbackslash geq\textbackslash!10\^\{9.3\}\textbackslash, M\_\textbackslash odot\$. L clumps favor disc gas fractions \$\textbackslash geq\textbackslash!0.3\$, low-mass bulges and redshifts \$z\textbackslash!\textbackslash sim\textbackslash! 2\$. The likelihood of L clumps is reduced if the feedback is more ejective, e.g., if the supernovae are optimally clustered, if radiative feedback is very strong, if the stellar initial mass function is top-heavy, or if the star-formation-rate efficiency is particularly high. A sub-type of L clumps (LS), which lose their gas in several free-fall times but retain bound stellar components, may be explained by a smaller contraction factor and stronger external gravitational effects, where clump mergers increase the SFR efficiency. The more massive L clumps (LL) retain most of their baryons for tens of free-fall times with a roughly constant star-formation rate.},

The embedding method is tuned to match the observed evolution of galaxy counts at different luminosities as well as the spatial clustering of the galaxy population. Galaxies are lensed by matter along the line of sight --- including magnification, shear, and multiple images --- using CALCLENS, an algorithm that calculates shear with 0.42 arcmin resolution at galaxy positions in the full catalog. The catalogs presented here, each with the same LCDM cosmology (denoted Buzzard), contain on average 820 million galaxies over an area of 1120 square degrees with positions, magnitudes, shapes, photometric errors, and photometric redshift estimates. We show that the weak-lensing shear catalog, redMaGiC galaxy catalogs and redMaPPer cluster catalogs provide plausible realizations of the same catalogs in the DES Y1 data by comparing their magnitude, color and redshift distributions, angular clustering, and mass-observable relations, making them useful for testing analyses that use these samples. We make public the galaxy samples appropriate for the DES Y1 data, as well as the data vectors used for cosmology analyses on these simulations.},

The cosmology module implements Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmologies including curvature, relativistic species, and different dark energy equations of state, and provides fast computations of the linear matter power spectrum, variance, and correlation function. The LSS module is concerned with the properties of peaks in Gaussian random fields and halos in a statistical sense, including their peak height, peak curvature, halo bias, and mass function. The halo module deals with spherical overdensity radii and masses, density profiles, concentration, and the splashback radius. To facilitate the rapid exploration of these quantities, COLOSSUS implements more than 40 different fitting functions from the literature. I discuss the core routines in detail, with particular emphasis on their accuracy. COLOSSUS is available at bitbucket.org/bdiemer/colossus.},

We show that the median and mean profiles of halo samples of a given peak height exhibit significant deviations from the universal analytic profiles discussed previously in the literature, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles, at radii r {$>$} 0.5 R200m. In particular, at these radii the logarithmic slope of the median density profiles of massive or rapidly accreting halos steepens more sharply than predicted. The steepest slope of the profiles occurs at r \textasciitilde{} R200m, and its absolute value increases with increasing peak height or mass accretion rate, reaching slopes of -4 and steeper. Importantly, we find that the outermost density profiles at r {$>$} R200m are remarkably self-similar when radii are rescaled by R200m. This self-similarity indicates that radii defined with respect to the mean density are preferred for describing the structure and evolution of the outer profiles. However, the inner density profiles are most self-similar when radii are rescaled by R200c. We propose a new fitting formula that describes the median and mean profiles of halo samples selected by their peak height or mass accretion rate with accuracy {$<$} 10\% at all radii, redshifts and masses we studied, r {$<$} 9 Rvir, 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 6 and Mvir {$>$} 1.7E10 Msun/h. We discuss observational signatures of the profile features described above, and show that the steepening of the outer profile should be detectable in future weak-lensing analyses of massive clusters. Such observations could be used to estimate the mass accretion rate of cluster halos.},

  abstract = {The density profiles of dark matter haloes can potentially probe dynamics, fundamental physics, and cosmology, but some of the most promising signals reside near or beyond the virial radius. While these scales have recently become observable, the profiles at large radii are still poorly understood theoretically, chiefly because the distribution of orbiting matter (the one-halo term) is partially concealed by particles falling into halos for the first time. We present an algorithm to dynamically disentangle the orbiting and infalling contributions by counting the pericentric passages of billions of simulation particles. We analyse dynamically split profiles out to 10 R200m across a wide range of halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. We show that the orbiting term experiences a sharp truncation at the edge of the orbit distribution. Its sharpness and position are mostly determined by the mass accretion rate, confirming that the entire profile shape primarily depends on halo dynamics and secondarily on mass, redshift, and cosmology. The infalling term also depends on the accretion rate for fast-accreting haloes but is mostly set by the environment for slowly accreting haloes, leading to a diverse array of shapes that does not conform to simple theoretical models. While the resulting scatter in the infalling term reaches 1 dex, the scatter in the orbiting term is only between 0.1 and 0.4 dex and almost independent of radius. We demonstrate a tight correspondence between the redshift evolution in LCDM and the slope of the matter power spectrum.},

  abstract = {Kinematic weak lensing describes the distortion of a galaxy's projected velocity field due to lensing shear, an effect recently reported for the first time by Gurri et al. based on a sample of 18 galaxies at \$z \textbackslash sim 0.1\$. In this paper, we develop a new formalism that combines the shape information from imaging surveys with the kinematic information from resolved spectroscopy to better constrain the lensing distortion of source galaxies and to potentially address systematic errors that affect conventional weak-lensing analyses. Using a Bayesian forward model applied to mock galaxy observations, we model distortions in the source galaxy's velocity field simultaneously with the apparent shear-induced offset between the kinematic and photometric major axes. We show that this combination dramatically reduces the statistical uncertainty on the inferred shear, yielding statistical error gains of a factor of 2--6 compared to kinematics alone. While we have not accounted for errors from intrinsic kinematic irregularities, our approach opens kinematic lensing studies to higher redshifts where resolved spectroscopy is more challenging. For example, we show that ground-based integral-field spectroscopy of background galaxies at \$z \textbackslash sim 0.7\$ can deliver gravitational shear measurements with S/N \$\textbackslash sim 1\$ per source galaxy at 1 arcminute separations from a galaxy cluster at \$z \textbackslash sim 0.3\$. This suggests that even modest samples observed with existing instruments could deliver improved galaxy cluster mass measurements and well-sampled probes of their halo mass profiles to large radii.},

Even after the Stage IV experiments, DESI and LSST, complete their surveys, there will still be much information left in the sky. This additional information will enable us to understand the physics underlying the dark universe at an even deeper level and, in case Stage IV surveys find hints for physics beyond the current Standard Model of Cosmology, to revolutionize our current view of the universe. There are many ideas for how best to supplement and aid DESI and LSST in order to access some of this remaining information and how surveys beyond Stage IV can fully exploit this regime.

  abstract = {Cosmic acceleration is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades. Testing and distinguishing among possible explanations requires cosmological measurements of extremely high precision probing the full history of cosmic expansion and structure growth and, ideally, compare and contrast matter and relativistic tracers of the gravity potential. This program is one of the defining objectives of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), as set forth in the New Worlds, New Horizons report (NWNH) in 2010. The WFIRST mission has the ability to improve these measurements by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to the current state of the art, while simultaneously extending their redshift grasp, greatly improving control of systematic effects, and taking a unified approach to multiple probes that provide complementary physical information and cross-checks of cosmological results. We describe in this annual report the activities of the Science Investigation Team (SIT) "Cosmology with the High Latitude Survey (HLS)" during the year 2017. This team was selected by NASA in December 2015 in order to address the stringent challenges of the WFIRST dark energy (DE) program through the Project's formulation phase. This SIT has elected to jointly address Galaxy Redshift Survey, Weak Lensing and Cluster Growth and thus fully embrace the fact that the imaging and spectroscopic elements of the HLS will be realized as an integrated observing program, and they jointly impose requirements on performance and operations. WFIRST is designed to be able to deliver a definitive result on the origin of cosmic acceleration. It is not optimized for Figure of Merit sensitivity but for control of systematic uncertainties and for having multiple techniques each with multiple cross-checks. Our SIT work focuses on understanding the potential systematics in the WFIRST DE measurements.},

This variability is an indicator of diversity in the formation history of these dark matter halos that is reflected in the coupling of scatters about the mean relations. In this work, we show that the strength of this coupling depends on the scale at which halo profiles are measured. By analyzing the outputs of the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, we report the radial- and mass-dependent couplings between the dark matter, hot gas, and stellar mass radial density profiles utilizing the population diversity in dark matter halos. We find that for the same mass halos, the scatters in the density of baryons and dark matter are strongly coupled at large scales (r {$>$} R 200), but the coupling between gas and dark matter density profiles fades near the core of halos (r {$<$} 0.3R 200). We then show that the correlation between halo profile and integrated quantities induces a radius-dependent additive bias in the profile observables of halos when halos are selected on properties other than their mass. We discuss the impact of this effect on cluster abundance and cross-correlation cosmology with multiwavelength cosmological surveys.},

Consequently, quantifying the statistical relationships between system-level observable properties of a population offers insights into the astrophysical drivers of that class of systems. While purely linear models capture behavior over a limited range of system scale, the fact that astrophysics is ultimately scale-dependent implies the need for a more flexible approach to describing population statistics over a wide dynamic range. For such applications, we introduce and implement a class of Kernel-Localized Linear Regression (KLLR) models. KLLR is a natural extension to the commonly-used linear models that allows the parameters of the linear model -- normalization, slope, and covariance matrix -- to be scale-dependent. KLLR performs inference in two steps: (1) it estimates the mean relation between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable and; (2) it estimates the conditional covariance of the dependent variables given a set of independent variables. We demonstrate the model's performance in a simulated setting and showcase an application of the proposed model in analyzing the baryonic content of dark matter halos. As a part of this work, we publicly release a Python implementation of the KLLR method.},

Blanco 4-meter telescope on Cerro Tololo near La Serena, Chile. The camera was designed and constructed by the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration, and meets or exceeds the stringent requirements designed for the wide-field and supernova surveys for which the collaboration uses it. The camera consists of a five element optical corrector, seven filters, a shutter with a 60 cm aperture, and a CCD focal plane of 250 micron thick fully-depleted CCDs cooled inside a vacuum Dewar. The 570 Mpixel focal plane comprises 62 2kx4k CCDs for imaging and 12 2kx2k CCDs for guiding and focus. The CCDs have 15 microns x15 microns pixels with a plate scale of 0.263 arc sec per pixel. A hexapod system provides state-of-the-art focus and alignment capability. The camera is read out in 20 seconds with 6-9 electrons readout noise. This paper provides a technical description of the camera's engineering, construction, installation, and current status.},

  abstract = {Characterization of the morphology of strongly lensed galaxies is challenging because images of such galaxies are typically highly distorted. Lens modeling and source plane reconstruction is one approach that can provide reasonably undistorted images from which morphological measurements can be made, though at the expense of a highly spatially variable telescope point-spread function (PSF) when mapped back to the source plane. Unfortunately, modeling the lensing mass is a time- and resource-intensive process, and in many cases there are too few constraints to precisely model the lensing mass. If, however, useful morphological measurements could be made in the image plane rather than the source plane, it would bypass this issue and obviate the need for a source reconstruction process for some applications. We examine the use of the Gini coefficient as one such measurement. Because it depends on the cumulative distribution of the light of a galaxy, but not the relative spatial positions, the fact that surface brightness is conserved by lensing means that the Gini coefficient may be well preserved by strong gravitational lensing. Through simulations, we test the extent to which the Gini coefficient is conserved, including by effects due to PSF convolution and pixelization, to determine whether it is invariant enough under lensing to be used as a measurement of galaxy morphology that can be made in the image plane.},

  abstract = {Correlated orientations of quasar optical and radio polarisation, and of radio jets, have been reported on Gpc scales, possibly arising from intrinsic alignment of spin axes. Optical quasar polarisation appears to be preferentially either aligned or orthogonal to the host large-scale structure, specifically large quasar groups (LQGs). Using a sample of 71 LQGs at redshifts \$1.0 \textbackslash leq z \textbackslash leq 1.8\$, we investigate whether LQGs themselves exhibit correlated orientation. We find that LQG position angles (PAs) are unlikely to be drawn from a uniform distribution (\$p\$-values \$0.008 \textbackslash lesssim p \textbackslash lesssim 0.07\$). The LQG PA distribution is bimodal, with median modes at \$\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash theta\}\textbackslash sim45\textbackslash pm2\^\{\textbackslash circ\}, 136\textbackslash pm2\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$, remarkably close to the mean angles of quasar radio polarisation reported in two regions coincident with our LQG sample. We quantify the degree of alignment in the PA data, and find that LQGs are aligned and orthogonal across very large scales. The maximum significance is \$\textbackslash simeq 0.8\textbackslash\%\$ (\$2.4\textbackslash sigma\$) at typical angular (proper) separations of \$\textbackslash sim 30\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ (1.6 Gpc). If the LQG orientation correlation is real, it represents large-scale structure alignment over scales larger than those predicted by cosmological simulations and at least an order of magnitude larger than any so far observed, with the exception of quasar-polarisation / radio-jet alignment. We conclude that LQG alignment helps explain quasar-polarisation / radio-jet alignment, but raises challenging questions about the origin of the LQG correlation and the assumptions of the concordance cosmological model.},

  abstract = {In cosmological N-body simulations, the representation of dark matter as discrete `macroparticles' suppresses the growth of structure, such that simulations no longer reproduce linear theory on small scales near kNyquist. Marcos et~al. demonstrate that this is due to sparse sampling of modes near kNyquist and that the often-assumed continuum growing modes are not proper growing modes of the particle system. We develop initial conditions (ICs) that respect the particle linear theory growing modes and then rescale the mode amplitudes to account for growth suppression. These ICs also allow us to take advantage of our very accurate N-body code abacus to implement second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT) in configuration space. The combination of 2LPT and rescaling improves the accuracy of the late-time power spectra, halo mass functions, and halo clustering. In particular, we achieve 1~per~cent accuracy in the power spectrum down to kNyquist, versus kNyquist/4 without rescaling or kNyquist/13 without 2LPT, relative to an oversampled reference simulation. We anticipate that our 2LPT will be useful for large simulations where fast Fourier transforms are expensive and that rescaling will be useful for suites of medium-resolution simulations used in cosmic emulators and galaxy survey mock catalogues. Code to generate ICs is available at https://github.com/lgarrison/zeldovich-PLT.},

In this paper, we present an emulator for the baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum. The emulator is based on the baryonification model, containing seven free parameters that are connected to the gas profiles and stellar abundances in haloes. We show that with the baryonic emulator, we can not only recover the power spectra of hydro-dynamical simulations at sub-percent precision but also establish a connection between the baryonic suppression of the power spectrum and the gas and stellar fractions in haloes. This connection allows us to predict the expected deviation from a dark-matter-only power spectrum using measured X-ray gas fractions of galaxy groups and clusters. With these measurements, we constrain the suppression to exceed the percent-level at k = 0.1-0.4 h/Mpc and to reach a maximum of 20-28 percent at around k = 7 h/Mpc (68 percent confidence level). As a further step, we also perform a detailed parameter study and we present a minimum set of four baryonic parameters that are required to recover the scale and redshift dependence observed in hydro-dynamical simulations.

  abstract = {Cosmological inference from cluster number counts is systematically limited by the accuracy of the mass calibration, i.e. the empirical determination of the mapping between cluster selection observables and halo mass. In this work we demonstrate a method to quantitatively determine the bias and uncertainties in weak-lensing mass calibration. To this end, we extract a library of projected matter density profiles from hydrodynamical simulations. Accounting for shear bias and noise, photometric redshift uncertainties, mis-centering, cluster member contamination, cluster morphological diversity, and line-of-sight projections, we produce a library of shear profiles. Fitting a one-parameter model to these profiles, we extract the so-called \textbackslash emph\{weak lensing mass\} \$M\_\textbackslash text\{WL\}\$. Relating the weak-lensing mass to the halo mass from gravity-only simulations with the same initial conditions as the hydrodynamical simulations allows us to estimate the impact of hydrodynamical effects on cluster number counts experiments. Creating new shear libraries for \$\textbackslash sim\$1000 different realizations of the systematics, provides a distribution of the parameters of the weak-lensing to halo mass relation, reflecting their systematic uncertainty. This result can be used as a prior for cosmological inference. We also discuss the impact of the inner fitting radius on the accuracy, and determine the outer fitting radius necessary to exclude the signal from neighboring structures. Our method is currently being applied to different Stage\textasciitilde III lensing surveys, and can easily be extended to Stage\textasciitilde IV lensing surveys.},

  abstract = {The redistribution of baryonic matter in massive halos through processes like active galactic nuclei feedback and star formation leads to a suppression of the matter power spectrum on small scales. This redistribution can be measured empirically via the gas and stellar mass fractions in galaxy clusters, and leaves imprints on their electron density profiles. We constrain two semi-analytical baryon correction models with a compilation of recent Bayesian population studies of galaxy groups and clusters sampling a mass range above \$\textbackslash sim 3 \textbackslash times 10\^\{13\}\$ \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$, and with cluster gas density profiles derived from deep, high-resolution X-ray observations. We are able to fit all the considered observational data, but highlight some anomalies in the observations. The constraints allow us to place precise, physically informed priors on the matter power spectrum suppression. At a scale of \$k=1 h\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ we find a suppression of \$0.042\^\{+0.012\}\_\{-0.014\}\$ (\$0.049\^\{+0.016\}\_\{-0.012\}\$), while at \$k=3h\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ we find \$0.184\^\{+0.026\}\_\{-0.031\}\$ (\$0.179\^\{+0.018\}\_\{-0.020\}\$), depending on the model used. We also predict at 97.5 percent credibility, that at scales \$k{$<$}0.37h\$ Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$ baryon feedback impacts the matter power less than \$1\textbackslash\%\$. This puts into question if baryon feedback is the driving factor for the discrepancy between cosmic shear and primary CMB results. We independently confirm results on this suppression from small-scale cosmic shear studies, while we exclude some hydro-dynamical simulations with too strong and too weak baryonic feedback. Our empirical prediction of the power spectrum suppression shows that studies of galaxy groups and clusters will be instrumental in unlocking the cosmological constraining power of future cosmic shear experiments like \textbackslash textit\{Euclid\} and Rubin-LSST.},

  abstract = {We perform a cross validation of the cluster catalog selected by the red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation algorithm (redMaPPer) in Dark Energy Survey year 1 (DES-Y1) data by matching it with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) selected cluster catalog from the South Pole Telescope SPT-SZ survey. Of the 1005 redMaPPer selected clusters with measured richness \$\textbackslash hat\textbackslash lambda{$>$}40\$ in the joint footprint, 207 are confirmed by SPT-SZ. Using the mass information from the SZE signal, we calibrate the richness--mass relation using a Bayesian cluster population model. We find a mass trend \$\textbackslash lambda\textbackslash propto M\^\{B\}\$ consistent with a linear relation (\$B\textbackslash sim1\$), no significant redshift evolution and an intrinsic scatter in richness of \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash lambda\} = 0.22\textbackslash pm0.06\$. At low richness SPT-SZ confirms fewer redMaPPer clusters than expected. We interpret this richness dependent deficit in confirmed systems as due to the increased presence at low richness of low mass objects not correctly accounted for by our richness-mass scatter model, which we call contaminants. At a richness \$\textbackslash hat \textbackslash lambda=40\$, this population makes up \${$>\$$}12\$\textbackslash\%\$ (97.5 percentile) of the total population. Extrapolating this to a measured richness \$\textbackslash hat \textbackslash lambda=20\$ yields \${$>\$$}22\$\textbackslash\%\$ (97.5 percentile). With these contamination fractions, the predicted redMaPPer number counts in different plausible cosmologies are compatible with the measured abundance. The presence of such a population is also a plausible explanation for the different mass trends (\$B\textbackslash sim0.75\$) obtained from mass calibration using purely optically selected clusters. The mean mass from stacked weak lensing (WL) measurements suggests that these low mass contaminants are galaxy groups with masses \$\textbackslash sim3\$-\$5\textbackslash times 10\^\{13\} \$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ which are beyond the sensitivity of current SZE and X-ray surveys but a natural target for SPT-3G and eROSITA.},

  abstract = {We construct and validate the selection function of the MARD-Y3 sample. This sample was selected through optical follow-up of the 2nd ROSAT faint source catalog (2RXS) with Dark Energy Survey year 3 (DES-Y3) data. The selection function is modeled by combining an empirically constructed X-ray selection function with an incompleteness model for the optical follow-up. We validate the joint selection function by testing the consistency of the constraints on the X-ray flux--mass and richness--mass scaling relation parameters derived from different sources of mass information: (1) cross-calibration using SPT-SZ clusters, (2) calibration using number counts in X-ray, in optical and in both X-ray and optical while marginalizing over cosmological parameters, and (3) other published analyses. We find that the constraints on the scaling relation from the number counts and SPT-SZ cross-calibration agree, indicating that our modeling of the selection function is adequate. Furthermore, we apply a largely cosmology independent method to validate selection functions via the computation of the probability of finding each cluster in the SPT-SZ sample in the MARD-Y3 sample and vice-versa. This test reveals no clear evidence for MARD-Y3 contamination, SPT-SZ incompleteness or outlier fraction. Finally, we discuss the prospects of the techniques presented here to limit systematic selection effects in future cluster cosmological studies.},

  abstract = {Studying giant star-forming clumps in distant galaxies is important to understand galaxy formation and evolution. At present, however, observers and theorists have not reached a consensus on whether the observed ``clumps'' in distant galaxies are the same phenomenon that is seen in simulations. In this paper, as a step to establish a benchmark of direct comparisons between observations and theories, we publish a sample of clumps constructed to represent the commonly observed ``clumps'' in the literature. This sample contains 3193 clumps detected from 1270 galaxies at 0.5{$\leq$}slant z{$<$} 3.0. The clumps are detected from rest-frame UV images, as described in our previous paper. Their physical properties (e.g., rest-frame color, stellar mass (\{M\}* ), star formation rate (SFR), age, and dust extinction) are measured by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) to synthetic stellar population models. We carefully test the procedures of measuring clump properties, especially the method of subtracting background fluxes from the diffuse component of galaxies. With our fiducial background subtraction, we find a radial clump U - V color variation, where clumps close to galactic centers are redder than those in outskirts. The slope of the color gradient (clump color as a function of their galactocentric distance scaled by the semimajor axis of galaxies) changes with redshift and \{M\}* of the host galaxies: at a fixed \{M\}* , the slope becomes steeper toward low redshift, and at a fixed redshift, it becomes slightly steeper with \{M\}* . Based on our SED fitting, this observed color gradient can be explained by a combination of a negative age gradient, a negative E(B - V) gradient, and a positive specific SFR gradient of the clumps. We also find that the color gradients of clumps are steeper than those of intra-clump regions. Correspondingly, the radial gradients of the derived physical properties of clumps are different from those of the diffuse component or intra-clump regions.},

All the models are built on the same high-resolution \$N\$-body simulations. We find that the HOD model generally provides the best performance in reproducing the clustering measurements in both projected and redshift spaces. The SHAM model with the same halo-galaxy relation for central and satellite galaxies (or distinct haloes and subhaloes), when including scatters, has a best-fitting \$\textbackslash chi\^2/\textbackslash rm\{dof\}\$ around \$2\$--\$3\$. We therefore extend the SHAM model to the subhalo clustering and abundance matching (SCAM) by allowing the central and satellite galaxies to have different galaxy--halo relations. We infer the corresponding halo/subhalo parameters by jointly fitting the galaxy 2PCFs and abundances and consider subhaloes selected based on three properties, the mass \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm acc\}\$ at the time of accretion, the maximum circular velocity \$V\_\{\textbackslash rm acc\}\$ at the time of accretion, and the peak maximum circular velocity \$V\_\{\textbackslash rm peak\}\$ over the history of the subhaloes. The three subhalo models work well for luminous galaxy samples (with luminosity above \$L\_*\$). For low-luminosity samples, the \$V\_\{\textbackslash rm acc\}\$ model stands out in reproducing the data, with the \$V\_\{\textbackslash rm peak\}\$ model slightly worse, while the \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm acc\}\$ model fails to fit the data. We discuss the implications of the modeling results.},

We selected a sample of systems based only on the properties of the sources, requiring them to be bright (apparent \$i\$-band magnitude \$ {$<$} 17.4\$) and in the nearby Universe (\$z {$<$} 0.15\$). We have observed the velocity fields of the sources with WiFeS, an optical IFU on a 2.3m telescope, and fitted them using a simple circular motion model with an external shear. We have measured an average shear of \$\textbackslash langle \textbackslash gamma \textbackslash rangle = 0.020 \textbackslash pm 0.008\$ compared to a predicted \$\textbackslash langle \textbackslash gamma\_\{pred\} \textbackslash rangle = 0.005\$ obtained using median stellar-to-halo relationships from the literature. While still a statistical approach, our results suggest that this new weak lensing methodology can overcome some of the limitations of traditional stacking-based techniques.

  abstract = {Models of stellar population synthesis (SPS) are the fundamental tool that relates the physical properties of a galaxy to its spectral energy distribution (SED). In this paper, we present DSPS: a python package for stellar population synthesis. All of the functionality in DSPS is implemented natively in the JAX library for automatic differentiation, and so our predictions for galaxy photometry are fully differentiable, and directly inherit the performance benefits of JAX, including portability onto GPUs. DSPS also implements several novel features, such as i) a flexible empirical model for stellar metallicity that incorporates correlations with stellar age, and ii) support for the diffstar model that provides a physically-motivated connection between the star formation history of a galaxy (SFH) and the mass assembly of its underlying dark matter halo. We detail a set of theoretical techniques for using autodiff to calculate gradients of predictions for galaxy SEDs with respect to SPS parameters that control a range of physical effects, including SFH, stellar metallicity, nebular emission, and dust attenuation. When forward modeling the colors of a synthetic galaxy population, we find that DSPS can provide a factor of 5 speedup over standard SPS codes on a CPU, and a factor of 300-400 on a modern GPU. When coupled with gradient-based techniques for optimization and inference, DSPS makes it practical to conduct expansive likelihood analyses of simulation-based models of the galaxy--halo connection that fully forward model galaxy spectra and photometry.},

These simulations use the subgrid physics models calibrated in the BAHAMAS project, which include feedback from both supernovae and active galactic nuclei. They form a cluster population covering almost two orders of magnitude in mass, with more than 3500 clusters with masses greater than 1014 M{$\odot$} at z = 0. We start by characterizing the clusters in terms of their spin, shape and density profile, before considering the bias in both weak lensing and hydrostatic mass estimates. Whilst including baryonic effects leads to more spherical, centrally concentrated clusters, the median weak lensing mass bias is unaffected by the presence of baryons. In both the dark matter only and hydrodynamic simulations, the weak lensing measurements underestimate cluster masses by {$\approx$}10 per cent for clusters with M200 {$\leq$} 1015 M{$\odot$} and this bias tends to zero at higher masses. We also consider the hydrostatic bias when using both the true density and temperature profiles, and those derived from X-ray spectroscopy. When using spectroscopic temperatures and densities, the hydrostatic bias decreases as a function of mass, leading to a bias of {$\approx$}40 per cent for clusters with M500 {$\geq$} 1015 M{$\odot$}. This is due to the presence of cooler gas in the cluster outskirts. Using mass weighted temperatures and the true density profile reduces this bias to 5-15 per cent.},

  abstract = {Galaxy clusters have a triaxial matter distribution. The weak-lensing signal, an important part in cosmological studies, measures the projected mass of all matter along the line-of-sight, and therefore changes with the orientation of the cluster. Studies suggest that the shape of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the centre of the cluster traces the underlying halo shape, enabling a method to account for projection effects. We use 324 simulated clusters at four redshifts between 0.1 and 0.6 from `The Three Hundred Project' to quantify correlations between the orientation and shape of the BCG and the halo. We find that haloes and their embedded BCGs are aligned, with an average \$\textbackslash sim\$20 degree angle between their major axes. The bias in weak lensing cluster mass estimates correlates with the orientation of both the halo and the BCG. Mimicking observations, we compute the projected shape of the BCG, as a measure of the BCG orientation, and find that it is most strongly correlated to the weak-lensing mass for relaxed clusters. We also test a 2-dimensional cluster relaxation proxy measured from BCG mass isocontours. The concentration of stellar mass in the projected BCG core compared to the total stellar mass provides an alternative proxy for the BCG orientation. We find that the concentration does not correlate to the weak-lensing mass bias, but does correlate with the true halo mass. These results indicate that the BCG shape and orientation for large samples of relaxed clusters can provide information to improve weak-lensing mass estimates.},

  abstract = {Cosmic shear surveys have great promise as tools for precision cosmology, but can be subject to systematic errors including intrinsic ellipticity correlations of the source galaxies. The intrinsic alignments are believed to be small for deep surveys, but this is based on intrinsic and lensing distortions being uncorrelated. Here we show that the gravitational lensing shear and intrinsic shear need not be independent: correlations between the tidal field and the intrinsic shear cause the intrinsic shear of nearby galaxies to be correlated with the gravitational shear acting on more distant galaxies. We estimate the magnitude of this effect for two simple intrinsic alignment models: one in which the galaxy ellipticity is linearly related to the tidal field, and one in which it is quadratic in the tidal field as suggested by tidal torque theory. The first model predicts a gravitational-intrinsic (GI) correlation that can be much greater than the intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation for broad redshift distributions, and that remains when galaxies pairs at similar redshifts are rejected. The second model, in its simplest form, predicts no gravitational-intrinsic correlation. In the first model and assuming a normalization consistent with recently claimed detections of intrinsic correlations we find that the GI correlation term can exceed the usual II term by {$>$}1 order of magnitude and the intrinsic correlation induced B-mode by 2 orders of magnitude. These interference effects can suppress the lensing power spectrum for a single broad redshift bin by of order \textasciitilde 10\% at z\_s=1 and \textasciitilde 30\% at z\_s=0.5.},

We find that the non-Gaussianity of the point spread function has a significant effect and can lead to an error of up to 15 per cent on the linear amplitude of fluctuations {$\sigma$}8, depending on the method of analysis. This could explain some of the discrepancies seen in recent amplitude determinations from weak lensing. Using an elliptical Laguerre expansion method we develop a re-Gaussianization method that reduces the error to a calibration error of the order of 1 per cent, even for poorly resolved galaxies. We also discuss a new type of shear selection bias, which results in up to roughly an 8 per cent underestimation of the signal. It is expected to scale with redshift, inducing errors in the growth factor extraction if not properly corrected for. Understanding and correcting for such effects is crucial if weak lensing is to become a high-precision probe of cosmology.},

Previous FIRE simulations used an identical source code (`FIRE-1') for consistency. Motivated by the development of more accurate numerics - including hydrodynamic solvers, gravitational softening, and supernova coupling algorithms - and exploration of new physics (e.g. magnetic fields), we introduce `FIRE-2', an updated numerical implementation of FIRE physics for the GIZMO code. We run a suite of simulations and compare against FIRE-1: overall, FIRE-2 improvements do not qualitatively change galaxy-scale properties. We pursue an extensive study of numerics versus physics. Details of the star formation algorithm, cooling physics, and chemistry have weak effects provided that we include metal-line cooling and star formation occurs at higher-than-mean densities. We present new resolution criteria for high-resolution galaxy simulations. Most galaxy-scale properties are robust to numerics we test, provided: (1) Toomre masses are resolved; (2) feedback coupling ensures conservation, and (3) individual supernovae are time-resolved. Stellar masses and profiles are most robust to resolution, followed by metal abundances and morphologies, followed by properties of winds and circum-galactic media. Central ({$\sim$}kpc) mass concentrations in massive ({$>$}L*) galaxies are sensitive to numerics (via trapping/recycling of winds in hot haloes). Multiple feedback mechanisms play key roles: supernovae regulate stellar masses/winds; stellar mass-loss fuels late star formation; radiative feedback suppresses accretion on to dwarfs and instantaneous star formation in discs. We provide all initial conditions and numerical algorithms used.},

We devise a method (the "TopN" test) to evaluate the scatter in the halo mass-observable relation for different tracers and inter-compare halo mass proxies in four number density bins using stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles. This test reveals three key findings. The stellar mass based on cModel photometry or aperture luminosity within R{$<$}30 kpc is a poor proxy of halo mass. In contrast, the stellar mass of the outer envelope is an excellent halo mass proxy. The stellar mass within R=[50,100] kpc, M*[50,100], has performance comparable to the state-of-the-art richness-based cluster finders at \$\textbackslash log\{M\_\{\textbackslash rm vir\}/M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\}{$>$}14.0\$ and could be a better halo mass tracer at lower halo masses. Finally, using N-body simulations, we find that the lensing profiles of massive halos selected by M*[50,100] are consistent with the expectation for a sample without projection or mis-centering effects. On the other hand, Richness-selected clusters display an excess at R\textasciitilde 1 Mpc in their lensing profiles, which may suggest a more significant impact from selection biases. These results suggest that Mstar-based tracers have distinct advantages in identifying massive halos, which could open up new avenues for cluster cosmology.},

  abstract = {Using deep images from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and taking advantage of its unprecedented weak lensing capabilities, we reveal a remarkably tight connection between the stellar mass distribution of massive central galaxies and their host dark matter halo mass. Massive galaxies with more extended stellar mass distributions tend to live in more massive dark matter haloes. We explain this connection with a phenomenological model that assumes, (1) a tight relation between the halo mass and the total stellar content in the halo, (2) that the fraction of in-situ and ex-situ mass at \$r{$<$}10\$ kpc depends on halo mass. This model provides an excellent description of the stellar mass functions (SMF) of total stellar mass (\$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\^\{\textbackslash rm Max\}\$) and stellar mass within inner 10 kpc (\$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\^\{10\}\$) and also reproduces the HSC weak lensing signals of massive galaxies with different stellar mass distributions. The best-fit model shows that halo mass varies significantly at fixed total stellar mass (as much as 0.4 dex) with a clear dependence on \$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\^\{10\}\$. Our two-parameter \$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\^\{\textbackslash rm Max\}\$-\$M\_\{\textbackslash star\}\^\{10\}\$ description provides a more accurate picture of the galaxy-halo connection at the high-mass end than the simple stellar-halo mass relation (SHMR) and opens a new window to connect the assembly history of halos with those of central galaxies. The model also predicts that the ex-situ component dominates the mass profiles of galaxies at \$r{$<$} 10\$ kpc for \$\textbackslash log M\_\{\textbackslash star\} \textbackslash ge 11.7\$).

  abstract = {A significant fraction of high redshift star-forming disc galaxies are known to host giant clumps, whose nature and role in galaxy evolution are yet to be understood. In this work, we first present a new method based on neural networks to detect clumps in galaxy images. We use this method to detect clumps in the rest-frame optical and UV images of a complete sample of \textasciitilde 1500 star forming galaxies at 1 {$<$} z {$<$} 3 in the CANDELS survey as well as in images from the VELA zoom-in cosmological simulations. We show that observational effects have a dramatic impact on the derived clump properties leading to an overestimation of the clump mass up to a factor of 10, which highlights the importance of fair comparisons between observations and simulations and the limitations of current HST data to study the resolved structure of distant galaxies. After correcting for these effects with a mixture density network, we estimate that the clump stellar mass function follows a power law down to the completeness limit (107 solar masses) with the majority of the clumps being less massive than 109 solar masses. This is in better agreement with recent gravitational lensing based measurements. The simulations explored in this work overall reproduce the shape of the observed clump stellar mass function and clumpy fractions when confronted under the same conditions, although they tend to lie in the lower limit of the confidence intervals of the observations. This agreement suggests that most of the observed clumps are formed in situ.},

  abstract = {The quantity and quality of cosmic structure observations have greatly accelerated in recent years, and further leaps forward will be facilitated by imminent projects. These will enable us to map the evolution of dark and baryonic matter density fluctuations over cosmic history. The way that these fluctuations vary over space and time is sensitive to several pieces of fundamental physics: the primordial perturbations generated by GUT-scale physics; neutrino masses and interactions; the nature of dark matter and dark energy. We focus on the last of these here: the ways that combining probes of growth with those of the cosmic expansion such as distance-redshift relations will pin down the mechanism driving the acceleration of the Universe. One way to explain the acceleration of the Universe is invoke dark energy parameterized by an equation of state w. Distance measurements provide one set of constraints on w, but dark energy also affects how rapidly structure grows; the greater the acceleration, the more suppressed the growth of structure. Upcoming surveys are therefore designed to probe w with direct observations of the distance scale and the growth of structure, each complementing the other on systematic errors and constraints on dark energy. A consistent set of results will greatly increase the reliability of the final answer. Another possibility is that there is no dark energy, but that General Relativity does not describe the laws of physics accurately on large scales. While the properties of gravity have been measured with exquisite precision at stellar system scales and densities, within our solar system and by binary pulsar systems, its properties in different environments are poorly constrained. To fully understand if General Relativity is the complete theory of gravity we must test gravity across a spectrum of scales and densities. Rapid developments in gravitational wave astronomy and numerical relativity are directed at testing gravity in the high curvature, high density regime. Cosmological evolution provides a polar opposite test bed, probing how gravity behaves in the lowest curvature, low density environments. There are a number of different implementations of astrophysically relevant modifications of gravity. Generically, the models are able to reproduce the distance measurements while at the same time altering the growth of structure. In particular, as detailed below, the Poisson equation relating over-densities to gravitational potentials is altered, and the potential that determines the geodesics of relativistic particles (such as photons) differs from the potential that determines the motion of non-relativistic particles. Upcoming surveys will exploit these differences to determine whether the acceleration of the Universe is due to dark energy or to modified gravity. To realize this potential, both wide field imaging and spectroscopic redshift surveys play crucial roles. Projects including DES, eBOSS, DESI, PFS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST are in line to map more than a 1000 cubic-billion-light-year volume of the Universe. These will map the cosmic structure growth rate to 1\% in the redshift range 0 {$<$} z {$<$} 2 , over the last 3/4 of the age of the Universe.},

  abstract = {Galaxies exhibit coherent alignments with local structure in the Universe. This effect, called Intrinsic Alignments (IA), is an important contributor to the systematic uncertainties for wide-field weak lensing surveys. On cosmological distance scales, intrinsic shape alignments have been observed in red galaxies, which are usually bulge-dominated; while blue galaxies, which are mostly disc-dominated, exhibit shape alignments consistent with a null detection. However, disc-dominated galaxies typically consist of two prominent structures: disc and bulge. Since the bulge component has similar properties as elliptical galaxies and is thought to have formed in a similar fashion, naturally one could ask whether the bulge components exhibit similar alignments as ellipticals? In this paper, we investigate how different components of galaxies exhibit IA in the TNG100-1 cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, as well as the dependence of IA on the fraction of stars in rotation-dominated structures at \$z=0\$. The measurements were controlled for mass differences between the samples. We find that the bulges exhibit significantly higher IA signals, with a nonlinear alignment model amplitude of \$A\_I = 2.98\^\{+0.36\}\_\{-0.37\}\$ compared to the amplitude for the galaxies as a whole (both components), \$A\_I = 1.13\^\{+0.37\}\_\{-0.35\}\$. The results for bulges are statistically consistent with those for elliptical galaxies, which have \$A\_I = 3.47\^\{+0.57\}\_\{-0.57\}\$. These results highlight the importance of studying galaxy dynamics in order to understand galaxy alignments and their cosmological implications.},

  abstract = {This dissertation studies the effects of dust in N-body simulations of interacting galaxies. A new Monte-Carlo radiative-transfer code, Sunrise, is used in conjunction with hydrodynamic simulations. Results from radiative-transfer calculations in over 20 SPH simulations of disk-galaxy major mergers (Cox, 2004) are presented. Dust has a profound effect on the appearance of these simulations. At peak luminosities, 90\% of the bolometric luminosity is absorbed by dust. The dust obscuration increases with luminosity in such a way that the brightness at UV/visual wavelengths remains roughly constant. A general relationship between the fraction of energy absorbed and the ratio of bolometric luminosity to baryonic mass is found to hold in galaxies with metallicities {$>$}0.7 [special characters omitted] over a factor of 50 in mass. The accuracy to which the simulations describe observed starburst galaxies is evaluated by comparing them to observations by Meurer et al. (1999) and Heckman et al. (1998). The simulations are found to follow a relation similar to the IRX-{$\beta$} relation found by Meurer et al. (1999) when similar luminosity objects are considered. The highest-luminosity simulated galaxies depart from this relation and occupy the region where local LIRGs/ULIRGs are found. Comparing to the Heckman et al. (1998) sample, the simulations are found to obey the same relations between UV luminosity, UV color, IR luminosity, absolute blue magnitude and metallicity as the observations. This agreement is contingent on the presence of a realistic mass-metallicity relation, and Milky-Way-like dust. SMC-like dust results in far too red a UV continuum slope. On the whole, the agreement between the simulated and observed galaxies is impressive considering that the simulations have not been fit to agree with the observations, and we conclude that the simulations provide a realistic replication of the real universe. The simulations are used to study the performance of star-formation indicators in the presence of dust. The far-infrared luminosity is found to be reliable. In contrast, the H{$\alpha$} and far-ultraviolet luminosities suffer severely from dust attenuation, and dust corrections can only partially remedy the situation.},

  abstract = {A new Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, SUNRISE, is used in conjunction with hydrodynamic simulations of major galaxy mergers to calculate the effects of dust in such systems. Dust has a profound effect on the emerging radiation, consistent with observations of dust absorption in starburst galaxies. The dust attenuation increases with luminosity such that at peak luminosities \textasciitilde 90\% of the bolometric luminosity is absorbed by dust. We find that our predictions agree with observed relationships between the UV spectral slope and the fraction of light absorbed by dust (IRX-{$\beta$}) and observational estimates of the optical depth as a function of intrinsic B-band or UV luminosity. In general, the detailed appearance of the merging event depends on the stage of the merger and the geometry of the encounter. The fraction of bolometric energy absorbed by the dust, however, is a robust quantity that can be predicted from the intrinsic properties bolometric luminosity, baryonic mass, star formation rate, and metallicity of the simulated system. This paper presents fitting formulae, valid over a wide range of masses and metallicities, from which the absorbed fraction of luminosity (and consequently also the infrared dust luminosity) can be predicted. The attenuation of the luminosity at specific wavelengths can also be predicted, albeit with a larger scatter due to the variation with viewing angle. These formulae for dust attenuation are consistent with earlier studies and would be suitable for inclusion in theoretical models, e.g., semianalytic models, of galaxy formation and evolution.},

Preserving the rank order is motivated by the fact that random variables drawn from Gaussian probability density functions with different means but equal standard deviations satisfy stochastic ordering. The process is repeated for sub-volumes surrounding each galaxy in the survey. This results in every galaxy with an uncertain redshift being assigned multiple "recovered" redshifts from which a new redshift estimate can be determined.

  abstract = {The structural evolution of substructure in cold dark matter (CDM) models is investigated combining ``low-resolution'' satellites from cosmological N-body simulations of parent halos with N=107 particles with high-resolution individual subhalos orbiting within a static host potential. We show that, as a result of mass loss, convergence in the central density profiles requires the initial satellites to be resolved with N=107 particles and parsec-scale force resolution. We find that the density profiles of substructure halos can be well fitted with a power-law central slope that is unmodified by tidal forces even after the tidal stripping of over 99\% of the initial mass and an exponential cutoff in the outer parts. The solution to the missing-satellites problem advocated by Stoehr et al. in 2002 relied on the flattening of the dark matter halo central density cusps by gravitational tides, enabling the observed satellites to be embedded within dark halos with maximum circular velocities as large as 60 km s-1. In contrast, our results suggest that tidal interactions do not provide the mechanism for associating the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Milky Way with the most massive substructure halos expected in a CDM universe. Motivated by the structure of our stripped satellites, we compare the predicted velocity dispersion profiles of Fornax and Draco to observations, assuming that they are embedded in CDM halos. We demonstrate that models with isotropic and tangentially anisotropic velocity distributions for the stellar component fit the data only if the surrounding dark matter halos have maximum circular velocities in the range 20-35 km s-1. If the dSphs are embedded within halos this large, then the overabundance of satellites within the concordance {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmological model is significantly alleviated, but this still does not provide the entire solution.},

  abstract = {We analyze the effect of dissipation on the shapes of dark matter (DM) halos using high-resolution cosmological gasdynamics simulations of clusters and galaxies in the LCDM cosmology. We find that halos formed in simulations with gas cooling are significantly more spherical than corresponding halos formed in adiabatic simulations. Gas cooling results in an average increase of the principle axis ratios of halos by \textasciitilde{} 0.2-0.4 in the inner regions. The systematic difference decreases slowly with radius but persists almost to the virial radius. We argue that the differences in simulations with and without cooling arise both during periods of quiescent evolution, when gas cools and condenses toward the center, and during major mergers. We perform a series of high-resolution N-body simulations to study the shapes of remnants in major mergers of DM halos and halos with embedded stellar disks. In the DM halo-only mergers, the shape of the remnants depends only on the orbital angular momentum of the encounter and not on the internal structure of the halos. However, significant shape changes in the DM distribution may result if stellar disks are included. In this case the shape of the DM halos is correlated with the morphology of the stellar remnants.},

Additionally, events such as galaxy mergers affect the relative alignments of both the shapes and angular momenta of galaxies throughout their history. These "intrinsic galaxy alignments" are known to exist, but are still poorly understood. This review will offer a pedagogical introduction to the current theories that describe intrinsic galaxy alignments, including the apparent difference in intrinsic alignment between early- and late-type galaxies and the latest efforts to model them analytically. It will then describe the ongoing efforts to simulate intrinsic alignments using both N-body and hydrodynamic simulations. Due to the relative youth of this field, there is still much to be done to understand intrinsic galaxy alignments and this review summarises the current state of the field, providing a solid basis for future work.},

  abstract = {Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter inhomogeneities along the line of sight. By measuring galaxy shape correlations, we can study the properties and evolution of structure on large scales as well as the geometry of the Universe. Thus, cosmic shear has become a powerful probe into the nature of dark matter and the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe. Over the last years, cosmic shear has evolved into a reliable and robust cosmological probe, providing measurements of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of its structure. We review here the principles of weak gravitational lensing and show how cosmic shear is interpreted in a cosmological context. Then we give an overview of weak-lensing measurements, and present the main observational cosmic-shear results since it was discovered 15 years ago, as well as the implications for cosmology. We then conclude with an outlook on the various future surveys and missions, for which cosmic shear is one of the main science drivers, and discuss promising new weak cosmological lensing techniques for future observations.},

In this review paper we summarise key measurements of galaxy alignments, divided by galaxy type, scale and environment. We also cover the statistics and formalism necessary to understand the observations in the literature. With the emergence of weak gravitational lensing as a precision probe of cosmology, galaxy alignments have taken on an added importance because they can mimic cosmic shear, the effect of gravitational lensing by large-scale structure on observed galaxy shapes. This makes galaxy alignments, commonly referred to as intrinsic alignments, an important systematic effect in weak lensing studies. We quantify the impact of intrinsic alignments on cosmic shear surveys and finish by reviewing practical mitigation techniques which attempt to remove contamination by intrinsic alignments.},

  abstract = {Clusters of galaxies are the most recently assembled, massive, bound structures in the Universe. As predicted by General Relativity, given their masses, clusters strongly deform space-time in their vicinity. Clusters act as some of the most powerful gravitational lenses in the Universe. Light rays traversing through clusters from distant sources are hence deflected, and the resulting images of these distant objects therefore appear distorted and magnified. Lensing by clusters occurs in two regimes, each with unique observational signatures. The strong lensing regime is characterized by effects readily seen by eye, namely, the production of giant arcs, multiple-images, and arclets. The weak lensing regime is characterized by small deformations in the shapes of background galaxies only detectable statistically. Cluster lenses have been exploited successfully to address several important current questions in cosmology: (i) the study of the lens(es) - understanding cluster mass distributions and issues pertaining to cluster formation and evolution, as well as constraining the nature of dark matter; (ii) the study of the lensed objects - probing the properties of the background lensed galaxy population - which is statistically at higher redshifts and of lower intrinsic luminosity thus enabling the probing of galaxy formation at the earliest times right up to the Dark Ages; and (iii) the study of the geometry of the Universe - as the strength of lensing depends on the ratios of angular diameter distances between the lens, source and observer, lens deflections are sensitive to the value of cosmological parameters and offer a powerful geometric tool to probe Dark Energy. In this review, we present the basics of cluster lensing and provide a current status report of the field.},

CosmoDC2 is the starting point for the second data challenge (DC2) carried out by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). The catalog is based on a trillion-particle, (4.225 Gpc)3 box cosmological N-body simulation, the Outer Rim run. It covers 440 deg2 of sky area to a redshift of z = 3 and matches expected number densities from contemporary surveys to a magnitude depth of 28 in the r band. Each galaxy is characterized by a multitude of galaxy properties including stellar mass, morphology, spectral energy distributions, broadband filter magnitudes, host halo information, and weak lensing shear. The size and complexity of cosmoDC2 requires an efficient catalog generation methodology; our approach is based on a new hybrid technique that combines data-based empirical approaches with semianalytic galaxy modeling. A wide range of observation-based validation tests has been implemented to ensure that cosmoDC2 enables the science goals of the planned LSST DESC DC2 analyses. This paper also represents the official release of the cosmoDC2 data set, including an efficient reader that facilitates interaction with the data.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic alignment (IA) of source galaxies is one of the major astrophysical systematics for ongoing and future weak lensing surveys. This paper presents the first forecasts of the impact of IA on cosmic shear measurements for current and future surveys (DES, Euclid, LSST, WFIRST) using simulated likelihood analyses and realistic covariances that include higher-order moments of the density field in the computation. We consider a range of possible IA scenarios and test mitigation schemes, which parameterize IA by the fraction of red galaxies, normalization, luminosity and redshift dependence of the IA signal (for a subset we consider joint IA and photo-z uncertainties). Compared to previous studies we find smaller biases in time-dependent dark energy models if IA is ignored in the analysis; the amplitude and significance of these biases vary as a function of survey properties (depth, statistical uncertainties), luminosity function, and IA scenario: Due to its small statistical errors and relatively shallow observing strategy Euclid is significantly impacted by IA. LSST and WFIRST benefit from their increased survey depth, while the larger statistical errors for DES decrease IA's relative impact on cosmological parameters. The proposed IA mitigation scheme removes parameter biases due to IA for DES, LSST, and WFIRST even if the shape of the IA power spectrum is only poorly known; successful IA mitigation for Euclid requires more prior information. We explore several alternative IA mitigation strategies for Euclid; in the absence of alignment of blue galaxies we recommend the exclusion of red (IA contaminated) galaxies in cosmic shear analyses. We find that even a reduction of 20\% in the number density of galaxies only leads to a 4-10\% loss in cosmological constraining power.},

  abstract = {We analyze the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and two-point correlation function of galaxy-size dark matter halos using high-resolution dissipationless simulations of the concordance flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model. The halo samples include both the host halos and the ``subhalos,'' distinct gravitationally bound halos within the virialized regions of larger host systems. We find that the HOD, the probability distribution for a halo of mass M to host a number of subhalos N, is similar to that found in semianalytic and N-body+gasdynamics studies. Its first moment, M, has a complicated shape consisting of a step, a shoulder, and a power-law high-mass tail. The HOD can be described by Poisson statistics at high halo masses but becomes sub-Poisson for M{$<\sptilde$}4. We show that the HOD can be understood as a combination of the probability for a halo of mass M to host a central galaxy and the probability to host a given number Ns of satellite galaxies. The former can be approximated by a steplike function, while the latter can be well approximated by a Poisson distribution, fully specified by its first moment. The first moment of the satellite HOD can be well described by a simple power law s{$>\sptilde$}M{$\beta$} with {$\beta\sptilde$}1 for a wide range of number densities, redshifts, and different power spectrum normalizations. This formulation provides a simple but accurate model for the halo occupation distribution found in simulations. At z=0, the two-point correlation function (CF) of galactic halos can be well fitted by a power law down to \textasciitilde 100 h-1 kpc with an amplitude and slope similar to those of observed galaxies. The dependence of correlation amplitude on the number density of objects is in general agreement with results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. At redshifts z{$>\sptilde$}1, we find significant departures from the power-law shape of the CF at small scales, where the CF steepens because of a more pronounced one-halo component. The departures from the power law may thus be easier to detect in high-redshift galaxy surveys than at the present-day epoch. They can be used to put useful constraints on the environments and formation of galaxies. If the deviations are as strong as indicated by our results, the assumption of the single power law often used in observational analyses of high-redshift clustering is dangerous and is likely to bias the estimates of the correlation length and slope of the correlation function.},

We outline both the areas in which highly accurate predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter halos hosting cluster, their mass function and clustering properties. Their study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar fractions, the thermodynamical and non-thermal processes in the intracluster plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the observed thermal properties of the intra-cluster plasma exhibit the most regular behavior and thus can be used to define robust observational proxies for the total cluster mass. We put particular emphasis on examining assumptions and limitations of the widely used self-similar model of clusters. Finally, we discuss the formation of clusters in non-standard cosmological models, such as non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified gravity, along with prospects for testing these alternative scenarios with large cluster surveys in the near future.},

  abstract = {Euclid is a space-based survey mission from the European Space Agency designed to understand the origin of the Universe's accelerating expansion. It will use cosmological probes to investigate the nature of dark energy, dark matter and gravity by tracking their observational signatures on the geometry of the universe and on the cosmic history of structure formation. The mission is optimised for two independent primary cosmological probes: Weak gravitational Lensing (WL) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The Euclid payload consists of a 1.2 m Korsch telescope designed to provide a large field of view. It carries two instruments with a common field-of-view of \textasciitilde 0.54 deg2: the visual imager (VIS) and the near infrared instrument (NISP) which contains a slitless spectrometer and a three bands photometer. The Euclid wide survey will cover 15,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky and is complemented by two 20 deg2 deep fields. For WL, Euclid measures the shapes of 30-40 resolved galaxies per arcmin2 in one broad visible R+I+Z band (550-920 nm). The photometric redshifts for these galaxies reach a precision of dz/(1+z) {$<$} 0.05. They are derived from three additional Euclid NIR bands (Y, J, H in the range 0.92-2.0 micron), complemented by ground based photometry in visible bands derived from public data or through engaged collaborations. The BAO are determined from a spectroscopic survey with a redshift accuracy dz/(1+z) =0.001. The slitless spectrometer, with spectral resolution \textasciitilde 250, predominantly detects Ha emission line galaxies. Euclid is a Medium Class mission of the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 programme, with a foreseen launch date in 2019. This report (also known as the Euclid Red Book) describes the outcome of the Phase A study.},

  abstract = {We present analysis of the three-dimensional shape of intracluster gas in clusters formed in cosmological simulations of the {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmology and compare it to the shape of dark matter distribution and the shape of the overall isopotential surfaces. We find that in simulations with radiative cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback (CSF), intracluster gas outside the cluster core (r {$\greaterequivlnt$} 0.1r500) is more spherical compared to non-radiative (NR) simulations, while in the core the gas in the CSF runs is more triaxial and has a distinctly oblate shape. The latter reflects the ongoing cooling of gas, which settles into a thick oblate ellipsoid as it loses thermal energy. The shape of the gas in the inner regions of clusters can therefore be a useful diagnostic of gas cooling. We find that gas traces the shape of the underlying potential rather well outside the core, as expected in hydrostatic equilibrium. At smaller radii, however, the gas and potential shapes differ significantly. In the CSF runs, the difference reflects the fact that gas is partly rotationally supported. Interestingly, we find that in NR simulations the difference between gas and potential shape at small radii is due to random gas motions, which make the gas distribution more spherical than the equipotential surfaces. Finally, we use mock Chandra X-ray maps to show that the differences in shapes observed in a three-dimensional distribution of gas are discernible in the ellipticity of X-ray isophotes. Contrasting the ellipticities measured in simulated clusters against observations can therefore constrain the amount of cooling in the intracluster medium and the presence of random gas motions in cluster cores.},

The HSC wide survey will be the first with the statistical capability of measuring the lensing signal with high signal-to-noise at log(M*)=8. At this same mass scale, LSST will have the most overall constraining power with a predicted signal-to-noise for the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal around dwarfs of SN=200. WFIRST and LSST will have the greatest potential to push below the log(M*) = 7 mass scale thanks to the depth of their imaging data. Studies of the dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies at z=0.1 with gravitational lensing are soon within reach. However, further work will be required to develop optimized strategies for extracting dwarfs samples from these surveys, determining redshifts, and accurately measuring lensing on small radial scales. Dwarf lensing will be a new and powerful tool to constrain the halo masses and inner density slopes of dwarf galaxies and to distinguish between baryonic feedback and modified dark matter scenarios.},

  abstract = {Lensing Without Borders is a cross-survey collaboration created to assess the consistency of galaxy-galaxy lensing signals (\$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash Sigma\$) across different data-sets and to carry out end-to-end tests of systematic errors. We perform a blind comparison of the amplitude of \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash Sigma\$ using lens samples from BOSS and six independent lensing surveys. We find good agreement between empirically estimated and reported systematic errors which agree to better than 2.3\$\textbackslash sigma\$ in four lens bins and three radial ranges. For lenses with \$z\_\{\textbackslash rm L\}{$>$}0.43\$ and considering statistical errors, we detect a 3-4\$\textbackslash sigma\$ correlation between lensing amplitude and survey depth. This correlation could arise from the increasing impact at higher redshift of unrecognised galaxy blends on shear calibration and imperfections in photometric redshift calibration. At \$z\_\{\textbackslash rm L\}{$>$}0.54\$ amplitudes may additionally correlate with foreground stellar density. The amplitude of these trends is within survey-defined systematic error budgets which are designed to include known shear and redshift calibration uncertainty. Using a fully empirical and conservative method, we do not find evidence for large unknown systematics. Systematic errors greater than 15\% (25\%) ruled out in three lens bins at 68\% (95\%) confidence at \$z{$<$}0.54\$. Differences with respect to predictions based on clustering are observed to be at the 20-30\% level. Our results therefore suggest that lensing systematics alone are unlikely to fully explain the "lensing is low" effect at \$z{$<$}0.54\$. This analysis demonstrates the power of cross-survey comparisons and provides a promising path for identifying and reducing systematics in future lensing analyses.},

  abstract = {We present high signal-to-noise galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements of the BOSS CMASS sample using 250 square degrees of weak lensing data from CFHTLenS and CS82. We compare this signal with predictions from mock catalogs trained to match observables including the stellar mass function and the projected and two dimensional clustering of CMASS. We show that the clustering of CMASS, together with standard models of the galaxy-halo connection, robustly predicts a lensing signal that is 20-40\% larger than observed. Detailed tests show that our results are robust to a variety of systematic effects. Lowering the value of \$S\_\{\textbackslash rm 8\}=\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash rm 8\} \textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm m\}/0.3\}\$ compared to Planck2015 reconciles the lensing with clustering. However, given the scale of our measurement (\$r{$<$}10\$ \$h\^\{-1\}\$ Mpc), other effects may also be at play and need to be taken into consideration. We explore the impact of baryon physics, assembly bias, massive neutrinos, and modifications to general relativity on \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash Sigma\$ and show that several of these effects may be non-negligible given the precision of our measurement. Disentangling cosmological effects from the details of the galaxy-halo connection, the effects of baryons, and massive neutrinos, is the next challenge facing joint lensing and clustering analyses. This is especially true in the context of large galaxy samples from Baryon Acoustic Oscillation surveys with precise measurements but complex selection functions.},

  abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the exciting science opportunities of the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6 deg\^2, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 deg\^2 south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r\textasciitilde 27.5. The LSST Science Book describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software, and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to z\textasciitilde 1, strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.},

  abstract = {As the statistical power of galaxy weak lensing reaches~per\,cent level precision, large, realistic, and robust simulations are required to calibrate observational systematics, especially given the increased importance of object blending as survey depths increase. To capture the coupled effects of blending in both shear and photometric redshift calibration, we define the effective redshift distribution for lensing, n{$\gamma$}(z), and describe how to estimate it using image simulations. We use an extensive suite of tailored image simulations to characterize the performance of the shear estimation pipeline applied to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data set. We describe the multiband, multi-epoch simulations, and demonstrate their high level of realism through comparisons to the real DES data. We isolate the effects that generate shear calibration biases by running variations on our fiducial simulation, and find that blending-related effects are the dominant contribution to the mean multiplicative bias of approximately \$-2\{\{\textbackslash{} \textbackslash rm per\textbackslash{} cent\}\}\$. By generating simulations with input shear signals that vary with redshift, we calibrate biases in our estimation of the effective redshift distribution, and demonstrate the importance of this approach when blending is present. We provide corrected effective redshift distributions that incorporate statistical and systematic uncertainties, ready for use in DES Year 3 weak lensing analyses.},

  abstract = {We present the results of attempts to detect the ellipticity of dark matter halos using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing with SDSS data. We use 2,020,256 galaxies brighter than r=19 with photometric redshifts (divided into colour and luminosity subsamples) as lenses and 31,697,869 source galaxies. We search for and identify several signal contaminants, which if not removed lead to a spurious detection. These include systematic shear that leads to a slight spurious alignment of lens and source ellipticities, intrinsic alignments (due to contamination of the source sample by physically-associated lens source pairs), and anisotropic magnification bias. We develop methods that allow us to remove these contaminants to the signal. We split the analysis into blue (spiral) and red (elliptical) galaxies. Assuming Gaussian errors as in previous work and a power-law profile, we find f\_h=e\_h/e\_g=0.1+/-0.06 for red galaxies and -0.8+/-0.4 for blue galaxies using 20-300 kpc/h, averaged over luminosity. Inclusion of the more realistic non-Gaussian error distributions and of the NFW density profile (which predicts much smaller ellipticity of the shear for scales above the scale radius) yields 0.60+/-0.38 for ellipticals and -1.4+1.7-2.0 for spirals. While there is no concrete detection of alignment in either case, there is a suggestion in the data of a positive alignment in the brightest lens sample of ellipticals. Our results appear to be mildly inconsistent with a previously reported detection by Hoekstra et al. (2004), but more data and further tests are needed to clarify whether the discrepancy is real or a consequence of differences in the lens galaxy samples used and analysis methods.},

Our sample consists of 34 galaxies, of halo masses 1011-1012 M{$\odot$} at z = 2, run with and without radiation pressure (RP) feedback from young stars. While RP has little effect on the sizes and global stability of discs, it reduces the amount of star-forming gas by a factor of {$\sim$}2, leading to a similar decrease in stellar mass by z {$\sim$} 2. Both samples undergo extended periods of violent disc instability continuously forming giant clumps of masses 107-109 M{$\odot$} at a similar rate, though RP significantly reduces the number of long-lived clumps (LLCs). When RP is (not) included, clumps with circular velocity {$\lessequivlnt$} 40 (20) km s- 1, baryonic surface density {$\lessequivlnt$} 200 (100)M{$\odot$} pc- 2 and baryonic mass {$\lessequivlnt$} 108.2 (107.3) M{$\odot$} are short-lived, disrupted in a few free-fall times. More massive and dense clumps survive and migrate towards the disc centre over a few disc orbital times. In the RP simulations, the distribution of clump masses and star formation rates (SFRs) normalized to their host disc is similar at all redshifts, exhibiting a truncated power law with a slope slightly shallower than -2. The specific SFR (sSFR) of the LLCs declines with age as they migrate towards the disc centre, producing gradients in mass, stellar age, gas fraction, sSFR and metallicity that distinguish them from the short-lived clumps which tend to populate the outer disc. Ex situ mergers comprise {$\sim$}37 per cent of the mass in clumps and {$\sim$}29 per cent of the SFR. They are more massive and with older stellar ages than the in situ clumps, especially near the disc edge. Roughly half the galaxies at redshifts z = 4-1 are clumpy, with {$\sim$}3-30 per cent of their SFR and {$\sim$}0.1-3 per cent of their stellar mass in clumps.},

Our sample consists of 770 snapshots in the redshift range z = 4-1 from 29 galaxies that at z = 2 span the stellar mass range (0.2-3) \texttimes{} 1011 M{$\odot$}. Extended gas discs exist in 83 per cent of the snapshots. Clumps are identified by gas density in 3D and their stellar and dark matter components are considered thereafter. While most of the overdensities are diffuse and elongated, 91 per cent of their mass and 83 per cent of their star formation rate (SFR) are in compact round clumps. Nearly all galaxies have a central, massive bulge clump, while 70 per cent of the discs show off-centre clumps, 3-4 per galaxy. The fraction of clumpy discs peaks at intermediate disc masses. Clumps are divided based on dark matter content into in situ and ex situ originating from violent disc instability (VDI) and minor mergers, respectively. 60 per cent of the discs are in a VDI phase showing off-centre in situ clumps, which contribute 1-7 per cent of the disc mass and 5-45 per cent of its SFR. The in situ clumps constitute 75 per cent of the off-centre clumps in terms of number and SFR but only half the mass, each clump containing on average 1 per cent of the disc mass and 6 per cent of its SFR. They have young stellar ages, 100-400 Myr, and high specific SFR (sSFR), 1-10 Gyr-1. They exhibit gradients resulting from inward clump migration, where the inner clumps are somewhat more massive and older, with lower gas fraction and sSFR and higher metallicity. Similar observed gradients indicate that clumps survive outflows. The ex situ clumps have stellar ages 0.5-3 Gyr and sSFR {$\sim$}0.1-2 Gyr-1, and they exhibit weaker gradients. Massive clumps of old stars at large radii are likely ex situ mergers, though half of them share the disc rotation.},

  abstract = {The finite sensitivity of instruments or detection methods means that data sets in many areas of astronomy, for example cosmological or exoplanet surveys, are necessarily systematically incomplete. Such data sets, where the population being investigated is of unknown size and only partially represented in the data, are called `truncated' in the statistical literature. Truncation can be accounted for through a relatively straightforward modification to the model being fitted in many circumstances, provided that the model can be extended to describe the population of undetected sources. Here, I examine the problem of regression using truncated data in general terms, and use a simple example to show the impact of selecting a subset of potential data on the dependent variable, on the independent variable, and on a second dependent variable that is correlated with the variable of interest. Special circumstances in which selection effects are ignorable are noted. I also comment on computational strategies for performing regression with truncated data, as an extension of methods that have become popular for the non-truncated case, and provide some general recommendations.},

Our data set consists of 238 cluster detections from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, and incorporates follow-up observations of 94 of those clusters using the Chandra X-ray Observatory or ROSAT. Here we describe and implement a new statistical framework required to self-consistently produce simultaneous constraints on cosmology and scaling relations from such data, and present results on models of dark energy. In spatially flat models with a constant dark energy equation of state, w, the cluster data yield {$\Omega$}m = 0.23 +/- 0.04,{$\sigma$}8 = 0.82 +/- 0.05 and w = -1.01 +/- 0.20, incorporating standard priors on the Hubble parameter and mean baryon density of the Universe, and marginalizing over conservative allowances for systematic uncertainties. These constraints agree well and are competitive with independent data in the form of cosmic microwave background anisotropies, type Ia supernovae, cluster gas mass fractions, baryon acoustic oscillations, galaxy redshift surveys and cosmic shear. The combination of our data with current microwave background, supernova, gas mass fraction and baryon acoustic oscillation data yields {$\Omega$}m = 0.27 +/- 0.02,{$\sigma$}8 = 0.79 +/- 0.03 and w = -0.96 +/- 0.06 for flat, constant w models. The combined data also allow us to investigate evolving w models. Marginalizing over transition redshifts in the range 0.05-1, we constrain the equation of state at late and early times to be respectively w0 = -0.88 +/- 0.21 and wet = -1.05+0.20-0.36, again including conservative systematic allowances. The combined data provide constraints equivalent to a Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit of 15.5. Our results highlight the power of X-ray studies, which enable the straightforward production of large, complete and pure cluster samples and admit tight scaling relations, to constrain cosmology. However, the new statistical framework we apply to this task is equally applicable to cluster studies at other wavelengths.},

The clusters are drawn from three samples based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey: the ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample (78/37 clusters detected/followed-up), the ROSAT-ESO Flux-Limited X-ray sample (126/25) and the bright sub-sample of the Massive Cluster Survey (34/32). Our analysis accounts self-consistently for all selection effects, covariances and systematic uncertainties. Here we describe the reduction of the follow-up X-ray observations, present results on the cluster scaling relations, and discuss their implications. Our constraints on the luminosity-mass and temperature-mass relations, measured within r500, lead to three important results. First, the data support the conclusion that excess heating of the intracluster medium (or a combination of heating and condensation of the coldest gas) has altered its thermodynamic state from that expected in a simple, gravitationally dominated system; however, this excess heat is primarily limited to the central regions of clusters (r {$<$} 0.15r500). Secondly, the intrinsic scatter in the centre-excised luminosity-mass relation is remarkably small, being bounded at the {$<$}10 per cent level in current data; for the hot, massive clusters under investigation, this scatter is smaller than in either the temperature-mass or YX-mass relations (10-15 per cent). Thirdly, the evolution with redshift of the scaling relations is consistent with the predictions of simple, self-similar models of gravitational collapse, indicating that the mechanism responsible for heating the central regions of clusters was in operation before redshift 0.5 (the limit of our data) and that its effects on global cluster properties have not evolved strongly since then. Our results provide a new benchmark for comparison with numerical simulations of cluster formation and evolution.},

These are the first such results obtained from an analysis that simultaneously accounts for selection effects and the underlying mass function, and directly incorporates lensing data to constrain total masses. Our constraints on the scaling relations and their intrinsic scatters are in good agreement with previous studies, and reinforce a picture in which departures from self-similar scaling laws are primarily limited to cluster cores. However, the data are beginning to reveal new features that have implications for cluster astrophysics and provide new tests for hydrodynamical simulations. We find a positive correlation in the intrinsic scatters of luminosity and temperature at fixed mass, which is related to the dynamical state of the clusters. While the evolution of the nominal scaling relations over the redshift range 0.0 {$<$} z {$<$} 0.5 is consistent with self-similarity, we find tentative evidence that the luminosity and temperature scatters, respectively, decrease and increase with redshift. Physically, this likely related to the development of cool cores and the rate of major mergers. We also examine the scaling relations of redMaPPer richness and Compton Y from Planck. While the richness-mass relation is in excellent agreement with recent work, the measured Y-mass relation departs strongly from that assumed in the Planck cluster cosmology analysis. The latter result is consistent with earlier comparisons of lensing and Planck scaling relation-derived masses.},

  abstract = {We constrain the mass--richness scaling relation of redMaPPer galaxy clusters identified in the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data using weak gravitational lensing. We split clusters into \$4\textbackslash times3\$ bins of richness \$\textbackslash lambda\$ and redshift \$z\$ for \$\textbackslash lambda\textbackslash geq20\$ and \$0.2 \textbackslash leq z \textbackslash leq 0.65\$ and measure the mean masses of these bins using their stacked weak lensing signal. By modeling the scaling relation as \$\textbackslash langle M\_\{\textbackslash rm 200m\}|\textbackslash lambda,z\textbackslash rangle = M\_0 (\textbackslash lambda/40)\^F ((1+z)/1.35)\^G\$, we constrain the normalization of the scaling relation at the 5.0 per cent level as \$M\_0 = [3.081 \textbackslash pm 0.075 (\{\textbackslash rm stat\}) \textbackslash pm 0.133 (\{\textbackslash rm sys\})] \textbackslash cdot 10\^\{14\}\textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$ at \$\textbackslash lambda=40\$ and \$z=0.35\$. The richness scaling index is constrained to be \$F=1.356 \textbackslash pm 0.051\textbackslash{} (\{\textbackslash rm stat\})\textbackslash pm 0.008\textbackslash{} (\{\textbackslash rm sys\})\$ and the redshift scaling index \$G=-0.30\textbackslash pm 0.30\textbackslash{} (\{\textbackslash rm stat\})\textbackslash pm 0.06\textbackslash{} (\{\textbackslash rm sys\})\$. These are the tightest measurements of the normalization and richness scaling index made to date. We use a semi-analytic covariance matrix to characterize the statistical errors in the recovered weak lensing profiles. Our analysis accounts for the following sources of systematic error: shear and photometric redshift errors, cluster miscentering, cluster member dilution of the source sample, systematic uncertainties in the modeling of the halo--mass correlation function, halo triaxiality, and projection effects. We discuss prospects for reducing this systematic error budget, which dominates the uncertainty on \$M\_0\$. Our result is in excellent agreement with, but has significantly smaller uncertainties than, previous measurements in the literature, and augurs well for the power of the DES cluster survey as a tool for precision cosmology and upcoming galaxy surveys such as LSST, Euclid and WFIRST.},

The amplitude of the mass-richness relation is in excellent agreement with the weak-lensing calibration of redMaPPer clusters in SDSS by Simet et al. and with the Saro et al. calibration based on abundance matching of SPT-detected clusters. Our results extend the redshift range over which the mass-richness relation of redMaPPer clusters has been calibrated with weak lensing from z {$\leq$} 0.3 to z {$\leq$} 0.8. Calibration uncertainties of shear measurements and photometric redshift estimates dominate our systematic error budget and require substantial improvements for forthcoming studies.\vphantom\}},

We use a forward modeling approach where we model the probability distribution of optical richness for a given mass, P(\{ln\}{$\lambda$} | M). To model the abundance and the stacked lensing profiles, we use an emulator specifically built to interpolate the halo mass function and the stacked lensing profile for an arbitrary set of halo mass and redshift, which is calibrated based on a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations. We apply our method to 8312 SDSS redMaPPer clusters with 20 {$\leq$} {$\lambda$} {$\leq$} 100 and 0.10 {$\leq$} z {$\lambda$} {$\leq$} 0.33 and show that the lognormal distribution model for P({$\lambda$} | M), with four free parameters, well reproduces the measured abundances and lensing profiles simultaneously. The constraints are characterized by the mean relation, {$<$} \{ln\}{$\lambda$} {$>$} (M)=A+B\{ln\}(M/\{M\}pivot\vphantom\{\}), with A=\{3.207\}-0.046+0.044 and B=\{0.993\}-0.055+0.041 (68\% CL), where the pivot mass scale M pivot = 3 \texttimes{} 1014 h -1 M {$\odot$}, and the scatter \{{$\sigma$} \}ln{$\lambda$} | M\vphantom\{\}=\{{$\sigma$} \}0+q\{ln\}(M/\{M\}pivot\vphantom\{\}) with \{{$\sigma$} \}0=\{0.456\}-0.039+0.047 and q=-\{0.169\}-0.026+0.035. We find that a large scatter in halo masses is required at the lowest-richness bins (20 {$\leq$} {$\lambda$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 30) in order to reproduce the measurements. Without such a large scatter, the model prediction for the lensing profiles tends to overestimate the measured amplitudes. This might imply a possible contamination of intrinsically low-richness clusters due to the projection effects. Such a low-mass halo contribution is significantly reduced when applying our method to the sample of 30 {$\leq$} {$\lambda$} {$\leq$} 100.},

  abstract = {Projection effects, whereby galaxies along the line-of-sight to a galaxy cluster are mistakenly associated with the cluster halo, present a significant challenge for optical cluster cosmology. We use statistically representative spectral coverage of luminous galaxies to investigate how projection effects impact the low-redshift limit of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redMaPPer galaxy cluster catalogue. Spectroscopic redshifts enable us to differentiate true cluster members from false positives and determine the fraction of candidate cluster members viewed in projection. Our main results can be summarized as follows: first, we show that a simple double-Gaussian model can be used to describe the distribution of line-of-sight velocities in the redMaPPer sample; second, the incidence of projection effects is substantial, accounting for \$\textbackslash sim 16\$ per cent of the weighted richness for the lowest richness objects; third, projection effects are a strong function of richness, with the contribution in the highest richness bin being several times smaller than for low-richness objects; fourth, our measurement has a similar amplitude to state-of-the-art models, but finds a steeper dependence of projection effects on richness than these models; and fifth, the slope of the observed velocity dispersion--richness relation, corrected for projection effects, implies an approximately linear relationship between the true, three-dimensional halo mass and three-dimensional richness. Our results provide a robust, empirical description of the impact of projection effects on the SDSS redMaPPer cluster sample and exemplify the synergies between optical imaging and spectroscopic data for studies of galaxy cluster astrophysics and cosmology.},

We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

We assess the performance of the emulator using a validation set of \$N\$-body simulations that are not used in training the emulator. We show that, for typical halos hosting CMASS galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the emulator predicts the halo-matter cross correlation, relevant for galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with an accuracy better than \$2\textbackslash\%\$ and the halo auto-correlation, relevant for galaxy clustering correlation, with an accuracy better than \$4\textbackslash\%\$. We give several demonstrations of the emulator. It can be used to study properties of halo mass density profiles such as the mass-concentration relation and splashback radius for different cosmologies. The emulator outputs can be combined with an analytical prescription of halo-galaxy connection such as the halo occupation distribution at the equation level, instead of using the mock catalogs, to make accurate predictions of galaxy clustering statistics such as the galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and the projected correlation function for any model within the \$w\$CDM cosmologies, in a few CPU seconds.},

Fixing a sheet width of 3 Mpc h-1 for definiteness, we find the sheet orientations and (connected) filamentary mass, halo mass and richness fractions relative to the surrounding sphere. Filaments usually have one or more end points outside the sheet determined by filament or halo mass or richness, with at least one having a large probability to be aligned with the perpendicular of the plane. Scatter in mock cluster mass measurements, for several observables, is often correlated with the observational direction relative to these local sheets, most often for richness and weak lensing, somewhat less for Compton decrement and least often for velocity dispersions.

Statistical modeling of such features often rely upon the evolving space-time density of dark matter halos -- the halo mass function (HMF) -- as a common theoretical ground for cosmological, astrophysical and fundamental physics studies. We propose a compact (eight parameter) representation of the HMF with readily interpretable parameters that stem from polynomial expansions, first in terms of log-mass, then expanding those coefficients similarly in redshift. We demonstrate good (\$\textbackslash sim \textbackslash! 5\textbackslash\%\$) agreement of this form, referred to as the dual-quadratic (DQ-HMF), with Mira-Titan N-body emulator estimates for halo masses above \$10\^\{13.7\} h\^\{-1\} \{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$ over the redshift range \$0.1 {$<$} z {$<$} 1.5\$, present best-fit parameters for a Planck 2018 cosmology, and present parameter variation in the \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 - \textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm m\}\$ plane. Convolving with a minimal mass-observable relation (MOR) yields closed-form expressions for counts, mean mass, and mass variance of cluster samples characterized by some observable property. Performing information-matrix forecasts of potential parameter constraints from existing and future surveys under different levels of systematic uncertainties, we demonstrate the potential for percent-level constraints on model parameters by an LSST-like optical cluster survey of 300,000 clusters and a richness-mass variance of \$0.3\^2\$. Even better constraints could potentially be achieved by a survey with one-tenth the sample size but with a reduced selection property variance of \$0.1\^2\$. Potential benefits and extensions to the basic MOR parameterization are discussed.},

  abstract = {We develop a new method of combining cluster observables (number counts and cluster-cluster correlation functions) and stacked weak lensing signals of background galaxy shapes, both of which are available in a wide-field optical imaging survey. Assuming that the clusters have secure redshift estimates, we show that the joint experiment enables a self-calibration of important systematic errors including the source redshift uncertainty and the cluster mass-observable relation, by adopting a single population of background source galaxies for the lensing analysis. It allows us to use the relative strengths of stacked lensing signals at different cluster redshifts for calibrating the source redshift uncertainty, which in turn leads to accurate measurements of the mean cluster mass in each bin. In addition, our formulation of stacked lensing signals in Fourier space simplifies the Fisher matrix calculations, as well as the marginalization over the cluster off-centering effect, the most significant uncertainty in stacked lensing. We show that upcoming wide-field surveys yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters including dark energy parameters, without any priors on nuisance parameters that model systematic uncertainties. Specifically, the stacked lensing information improves the dark energy FoM by a factor of 4, compared to that from the cluster observables alone. The primordial non-Gaussianity parameter can also be constrained with a level of f\_NL\textasciitilde 10. In this method, the mean source redshift is well calibrated to an accuracy of 0.1 in redshift, and the mean cluster mass in each bin to 5-10\% accuracies, which demonstrates the success of the self-calibration of systematic uncertainties from the joint experiment.

We measure shapes of the DM haloes by strong gravitational lensing, whereas BCG shapes are derived from their light profiles in Hubble Space Telescope images. Our measurements from a large sample of massive clusters presented here provide new constraints on dark matter and cluster astrophysics. We find that DM haloes are on average highly elongated with the mean ellipticity of \$0.482\textbackslash pm 0.028\$, and position angles of major axes of DM haloes and their BCGs tend to be aligned well with the mean value of alignment angles of \$22.2\textbackslash pm 3.9\$ deg. We find that DM haloes in our sample are on average more elongated than their BCGs with the mean difference of their ellipticities of \$0.11\textbackslash pm 0.03\$. In contrast, the Horizon-AGN cosmological hydrodynamical simulation predicts on average similar ellipticities between DM haloes and their central galaxies. While such a difference between the observations and the simulation may well be explained by the difference of their halo mass scales, other possibilities include the bias inherent to strong lensing measurements, limited knowledge of baryon physics, or a limitation of cold dark matter.},

  abstract = {We present a fast methodology to produce mock observations of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects based on the dark matter only \$N\$-body simulations coupled with the analytic intra-cluster medium model. The methods employ two different approaches: halo-based pasting (HP) and particle-based pasting (PP). The former pastes gas density and pressure onto halos and requires only a halo catalogue, and the latter considers the contribution from field particles as well, i.e., particles that do not belong to any halos and thus utilise the full particle information. Therefore, the PP algorithm incorporates secondary effects beyond the HP algorithm: asphericity of halos and contribution from diffuse gas. In particular, such a diffuse component is the dominant source of the kinetic SZ effect. As validation of our methods, we have produced 108 all-sky maps with HP and 108 flat-sky maps, which cover \$5 \textbackslash times 5 \textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{deg\}\^2\$ with both HP and PP, and measured power spectra of the maps. Our method can produce a mock map within a few hours, even for all-sky coverage with a parallel computational environment. The power spectra of HP maps are consistent with the halo model prediction of the thermal SZ effect. On the other hand, the power spectra of PP maps are suppressed due to the halo asphericity but can reproduce better the theoretical prediction for the kinetic SZ effect. We discuss the utility of baryon-pasted mock SZ maps for estimating the covariance matrix of SZ statistics and modelling the selection and projection effects for cluster cosmology.},

We find that, when major axes of haloes are aligned with the line-of-sight direction, surface mass density profiles have higher amplitudes than those averaged over all halo orientations, over all scales from 0.1 to 100\,Mpc\,h-1 we studied. While the orientation dependence at small scales is ascribed to the halo triaxiality, our results indicate even stronger orientation dependence in the so-called two-halo regime, up to 100\,Mpc\,h-1. The orientation dependence for the two-halo term is well approximated by a multiplicative shift of the amplitude and therefore a shift in the halo bias parameter value. The halo bias from the two-halo term can be overestimated or underestimated by up to \$\{\textbackslash sim \} 30\textbackslash hbox\{ per cent\}\$ depending on the viewing angle, which translates into the bias in estimated halo masses by up to a factor of 2 from halo bias measurements. The orientation dependence at large scales originates from the anisotropic halo\textendash matter correlation function, which has an elliptical shape with the axis ratio of {$\sim$}0.55 up to 100\,Mpc\,h-1. We discuss potential impacts of halo orientation bias on other observables such as optically selected cluster samples and a clustering analysis of large-scale structure tracers such as quasars.},

Our analysis notably includes an empirical model for the anisotropic boosts impacting the lensing and clustering signals of optical clusters. These boosts arise from a preferential selection of clusters surrounded by anisotropic large scale structure, a consequence of the limited discrimination between line-of-sight interlopers and true cluster members offered by photometric surveys. We validate our analysis via a blind cosmology challenge on mocks, and find that we can obtain tight and unbiased cosmological constraints without informative priors or external calibrations on any of our model parameters. We then apply our analysis on the SDSS redMaPPer clusters, and find results favoring low \$\textbackslash Omega\_\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\$ and high \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, combining to yield the lensing strength constraint \$S\_8 = 0.718\_\{-0.015\}\^\{+0.016\}\$. We investigate potential drivers behind these results through a series of post-unblinding tests, noting that our results are consistent with existing cluster cosmology constraints but clearly inconsistent with other CMB/LSS based cosmology results. From these tests, we find hints that a suppression in the cluster lensing signal may be driving our results.},

  abstract = {Physics welcomes the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein's cosmological constant, {$\Lambda$}; today the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics also suggests that dark energy could be dynamical, allowing for the arguably appealing picture of an evolving dark-energy density approaching its natural value, zero, and small now because the expanding universe is old. This would alleviate the classical problem of the curious energy scale of a millielectron volt associated with a constant {$\Lambda$}. Dark energy may have been detected by recent cosmological tests. These tests make a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-Lema\^itre model, in which the gravitational inverse-square law is applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one-quarter of the critical Einstein\textendash de Sitter value. The case for detection of dark energy is not yet as convincing but still serious; we await more data, which may be derived from work in progress. Planned observations may detect the evolution of the dark-energy density; a positive result would be a considerable stimulus for attempts at understanding the microphysics of dark energy. This review presents the basic physics and astronomy of the subject, reviews the history of ideas, assesses the state of the observational evidence, and comments on recent developments in the search for a fundamental theory.},

One criterion that can be measured is the publication record of an applicant. The publication records of past fellowship recipients may, therefore, provide some quantitative guidance for future prospective applicants. We investigated the publication patterns of recipients of the NASA prize postdoctoral fellowships in the Hubble, Einstein, and Sagan programs from 2014 through 2017, using the NASA ADS reference system. We tabulated their publications at the point where fellowship applications were submitted, and we find that the 133 fellowship recipients in that time frame had a median of 6 +/- 2 first-author publications, and 14 +/- 6 co-authored publications. The full range of first author papers is 1 to 15, and for all papers ranges from 2 to 76, indicating very diverse publication patterns. Thus, while fellowship recipients generally have strong publication records, the distribution of both first-author and co-authored papers is quite broad; there is no apparent threshold of publications necessary to obtain these fellowships. We also examined the post-PhD publication rates for each of the three fellowship programs, between male and female recipients, across the four years of the analysis and find no consistent trends. We hope that these findings will prove a useful reference to future junior scientists.},

The convergence proof is based on describing the statistics of our estimator using waiting-times distributions, as the exponential or Erlang. We illustrate the proposed estimators and show how they compare to existing methods based on density estimation, and we also outline how our divergence estimators can be used for solving the two-sample problem.},

Hints for such an abrupt transition with weaker gravity at times before the transition, have recently been identified in Tully Fisher galactic mass-velocity data and also in Cepheid SnIa calibrator data. Here we use Monte-Carlo simulations to show that such a transition could significantly increase (by a factor of 3 or more) the number of long period comets (LPCs) impacting the solar system from the Oort cloud (semi-major axis of orbits \$\textbackslash gtrsim 10\^4AU\$). This increase is consistent with observational evidence from the terrestrial and lunar cratering rates indicating that the impact flux of kilometer sized objects increased by at least a factor of 2 over that last 100 Myrs compared to the long term average. This increase may also be connected with the Chicxulub impactor event that produced the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) extinction of 75\% of life on Earth (including dinosaurs) about 66 Myrs ago. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to show that for isotropic Oort cloud comet distribution with initially circular orbits, random velocity perturbations (induced eg by passing stars and/or galactic tidal effects), lead to a deformation of the orbits that increases significantly when \$G\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}\$ increases. A 10\% increase of \$G\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}\$ leads to an increase in the probability of the comets to enter the loss cone and reach the planetary region (pericenter of less than 10AU) by a factor that ranges from 5\% (for velocity perturbation much smaller than the comet initial velocity) to more than 300\% (for total velocity perturbations comparable with the initial comet velocity).},

  abstract = {We consider an expanding Friedmann cosmology containing a "gas" of self-gravitating masses. The masses condense into aggregates which (when sufficiently bound) we identify as single particles of a larger mass. We propose that after this process has proceeded through several scales, the mass spectrum of condensations becomes "self-similar" and independent of the spectrum initially assumed. Some details of the self-similar distribution, and its evolution in time, can be calculated with the linear perturbation theory. Unlike other authors, we make no ad hoc assumptions about the spectrum of long-wavelength initial perturbatidns: the nonlinear N-body interactions of the mass points randomize their positions and generate a perturbation to all larger scales; this should fix the self-similar distribution almost uniquely. The results of numerical experiments on 1000 bodies are presented; these appear to show new nonlinear effects: condensations can "bootstrap" their way up in size faster than the linear theory predicts. Our self-similar model predicts relations between the masses and radii of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, as well as their mass spectra. We compare the predictions with available data, and find some rather striking agreements. If the model is to explain galaxies, then isothermal "seed" masses of 3 x 1 0 M0 must have existed at recombination. To explain clusters of galaxies, the only necessary seeds are the galaxies themselves. The size of clusters determines, in principle, the deceleration parameter q0 presently available data give only very broad limits, unfortunately.

  abstract = {We provide new constraints on the connection between galaxies in the local universe, identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and dark matter halos and their constituent substructures in the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model using WMAP7 cosmological parameters. Predictions for the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, and the relationship between dark matter hosts and substructures, are based on a high-resolution cosmological simulation, the Bolshoi simulation. We associate galaxies with halos and subhalos using subhalo abundance matching, performing a comprehensive analysis which investigates the underlying assumptions of this technique including (a) which halo property is most closely associated with galaxy stellar masses and luminosities, (b) how much scatter is in this relationship, and (c) how much subhalos can be stripped before their galaxies are destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new measurements of the projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed conditional stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. The data put tight constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxy stellar mass, on the scatter between halo and galaxy properties, and on the underlying conditional stellar mass function. These data rule out several halo properties commonly used in abundance matching, largely because the satellite fractions in the models disagree with those data. We show that an abundance matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity of their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of \$0.20 \textbackslash pm 0.03\$ dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included. This will yield important constraints for galaxy formation models, and also provides encouraging indications that the galaxy--halo connection can be modeled with sufficient fidelity for future precision studies of the dark Universe.},

This white paper describes an integrated Guaranteed Time Observer program using 800 hours of prime time and 800 hours of parallel time to study the formation and evolution of galaxies from z \textasciitilde 2 to z\textasciitilde 14, combining NIRSpec, NIRCam, and MIRI data in a coordinated observing program. These programs are likely to shape the course of high redshift investigations for the 2020s. NIRCam will be used to image over 200 square arc minutes using a suite of seven wide filters and two medium width filters to create an imaging dataset used for multiple goals including derivation of luminosity functions beyond the current redshift frontier, the early evolution of galaxy morphologies, discovery of the first quenched galaxies, stellar mass buildup in the first billion years, study of morphologies versus redshift, estimation of photometric redshifts, and selection of objects for spectroscopy with NIRSpec. Spectra of several thousand galaxies from the NIRSpec portion of the program will enable studies such as measuring chemical enrichment and the build-up of stellar mass with redshift, disappearance of Lyman- during reionization, and the role of feedback in shaping the evolution of galaxies. We hope to increase the value of our survey to the community early in the decade and in the scientific life of JWST by releasing some imaging and spectroscopic data prior to the end of the JADES proprietary period.},

We use two independent methods: A modified version of the two-point cross-correlation function and the angle between the central galaxy orientation and the satellite galaxies relative position. The first method allows us to study the inner and outer regions of the cluster, while the second method provides information within the halos. Our results show that central galaxies present anysotropy in the correlation function up to \$\textbackslash sim 10 h\^\{-1\}Mpc\$, which becomes \$\textbackslash sim\$10\textbackslash\% stronger for the brightest ones (\$\^\{0.1\}M\_\{r\}{$<$}-21.5\$). When we split the galaxy sample by colour, we find that red central galaxies are the main contributors to this anisotropy. We also show that this behaviour does not depend on the group mass or central galaxy ellipticity. Finally, our results are in agreement with previous findings, showing that the two-point cross-correlation function is a best tracer of the galaxy alignments using all galaxies and not only those of the group to which it belongs. In addition, this feature allows us to explore the behaviour of the alignment on larger scales.},

We describe a multivariate scaling model that enables a fully self-consistent treatment of multiple observational catalogues in the presence of property covariance and apply this formalism when interpreting published results. The corrections due to scatter and observable covariance can be significant. For instance, our predicted YSZ-LX scaling relation differs from that derived using the naive `plug in' method by {$\approx$}25\,per\,cent.

These improvements are largely due to the better treatment of galaxy color data. We also demonstrate the scatter in the LX -richness relation depends on the aperture used to estimate cluster richness, and introduce a novel approach for optimizing said aperture which can easily be generalized to other mass tracers.},

The algorithm was specifically developed to minimize photometric redshift uncertainties in photometric large-scale structure studies. redMaGiC achieves this by self-training the colour cuts necessary to produce a luminosity-thresholded LRG sample of constant comoving density. We demonstrate that redMaGiC photo-zs are very nearly as accurate as the best machine learning-based methods, yet they require minimal spectroscopic training, do not suffer from extrapolation biases, and are very nearly Gaussian. We apply our algorithm to Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data to produce a redMaGiC catalogue sampling the redshift range z {$\in$} [0.2, 0.8]. Our fiducial sample has a comoving space density of 10-3\,(h-1\,Mpc)-3, and a median photo-z bias (zspec - zphoto) and scatter ({$\sigma$}z/(1 + z)) of 0.005 and 0.017, respectively. The corresponding 5{$\sigma$} outlier fraction is 1.4~per~cent. We also test our algorithm with Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 and Stripe 82 data, and discuss how spectroscopic training can be used to control photo-z biases at the 0.1~per~cent level.},

These common clusters define a tight scaling relation in the richness-SZ mass (\$\textbackslash lambda\$--\$M\_\{SZ\}\$) plane, with an intrinsic scatter in richness of \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash lambda|M\_\{SZ\}\} = 0.266 \textbackslash pm 0.017\$. The corresponding intrinsic scatter in true cluster halo mass at fixed richness is \$\textbackslash approx 21\textbackslash\%\$. The regularity of this scaling relation is used to identify failures in both the redMaPPer and Planck cluster catalogs. Of the 245 galaxy clusters in common, we identify three failures in redMaPPer and 36 failures in the PSZ1. Of these, at least 12 are due to clusters whose optical counterpart was correctly identified in the PSZ1, but where the quoted redshift for the optical counterpart in the external data base used in the PSZ1 was incorrect. The failure rates for redMaPPer and the PSZ1 are \$1.2\textbackslash\%\$ and \$14.7\textbackslash\%\$ respectively, or 9.8\% in the PSZ1 after subtracting the external data base errors. We have further identified 5 PSZ1 sources that suffer from projection effects (multiple rich systems along the line-of-sight of the SZ detection) and 17 new high redshift (\$z\textbackslash gtrsim 0.6\$) cluster candidates of varying degrees of confidence. Should all of the high-redshift cluster candidates identified here be confirmed, we will have tripled the number of high redshift Planck clusters in the SDSS region. Our results highlight the power of multi-wavelength observations to identify and characterize systematic errors in galaxy cluster data sets, and clearly establish photometric data both as a robust cluster finding method, and as an important part of defining clean galaxy cluster samples.},

We find small - but correctable - biases, sourced by three different systematics. The first two were expected a priori, namely blue cluster galaxies and correlated structure along the line of sight. The third systematic is new: the redMaPPer template fitting exhibits a non-trivial dependence on photometric noise, which biases the original redMaPPer probabilities when utilizing noisy data. After correcting for these effects, we find exquisite agreement (\$\textbackslash approx 1\textbackslash\%\$) between the photometric probability estimates and the spectroscopic membership rates, demonstrating that we can robustly recover cluster membership estimates from photometric data alone. As a byproduct of our analysis we find that on average unavoidable projection effects from correlated structure contribute \$\textbackslash approx 6\textbackslash\%\$ of the richness of a redMaPPer galaxy cluster.

  abstract = {When extracting the weak lensing shear signal, one may employ either locally normalized or globally normalized shear estimators. The former is the standard approach when estimating cluster masses, while the latter is the more common method among peak finding efforts. While both approaches have identical signal-to-noise in the weak lensing limit, it is possible that higher order corrections or systematics considerations make one estimator preferable over the other. In this paper, we consider the efficacy of both estimators within the context of stacked weak lensing mass estimation in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We find the two estimators have nearly identical statistical precision, even after including higher order corrections, but that these corrections must be incorporated into the analysis to avoid observationally relevant biases in the recovered masses. We also demonstrate that finite bin-width effects may be significant if not properly accounted for, and that the two estimators exhibit different systematics, particularly with respect to contamination of the source catalog by foreground galaxies. Thus, the two estimators may be employed as a systematics cross-check of each other. Stacked weak lensing in the DES should allow for the mean mass of galaxy clusters to be calibrated to about 2\% precision (statistical only), which can improve the figure of merit of the DES cluster abundance experiment by a factor of \textasciitilde 3 relative to the self-calibration expectation. A companion paper (Schmidt \& Rozo, 2010) investigates how the two types of estimators considered here impact weak lensing peak finding efforts.},

The telescope is designed for conducting large-area millimeter and sub-millimeter wave surveys of faint, low contrast emission, as required to map primary and secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. To achieve the required sensitivity and resolution, the telescope design employs an off-axis primary with a 10 meter diameter clear aperture. The full aperture and the associated optics will have a combined surface accuracy of better than 20 microns rms to allow precision operation in the submillimeter atmospheric windows. The telescope will be surrounded with a large reflecting ground screen to reduce sensitivity to thermal emission from the ground and local interference. The optics of the telescope will support a degree field of view at 2mm wavelength and will feed a new 1000-element micro-lithographed planar bolometric array with superconducting transition-edge sensors and frequency-multiplexed readouts. The first key project will be to conduct a survey over \$\textbackslash sim 4000\$ degrees for galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect. This survey should find many thousands of clusters with a mass selection criteria that is remarkably uniform with redshift.

  abstract = {Reducing the scatter between cluster mass and optical richness is a key goal for cluster cosmology from photometric catalogs. We consider various modifications to the red-sequence-matched filter richness estimator of Rozo et al. implemented on the maxBCG cluster catalog and evaluate the impact of these changes on the scatter in X-ray luminosity (LX ) at fixed richness, using LX from the ROSAT All-Sky Catalog as the best mass proxy available for the large area required. Most significantly, we find that deeper luminosity cuts can reduce the recovered scatter, finding that \textbackslash sigma \_\{\textbackslash ln L\_X|\textbackslash lambda \}=0.63+/- 0.02 for clusters with M 500c {$>\sptilde$} 1.6 \texttimes{} 1014 h -1 70 M {$\odot$}. The corresponding scatter in mass at fixed richness is {$\sigma$}ln M|{$\lambda$} {$\approx$} 0.2-0.3 depending on the richness, comparable to that for total X-ray luminosity. We find that including blue galaxies in the richness estimate increases the scatter, as does weighting galaxies by their optical luminosity. We further demonstrate that our richness estimator is very robust. Specifically, the filter employed when estimating richness can be calibrated directly from the data, without requiring a priori calibrations of the red sequence. We also demonstrate that the recovered richness is robust to up to 50\% uncertainties in the galaxy background, as well as to the choice of photometric filter employed, so long as the filters span the 4000 \AA{} break of red-sequence galaxies. Consequently, our richness estimator can be used to compare richness estimates of different clusters, even if they do not share the same photometric data. Appendix A includes "easy-bake" instructions for implementing our optimal richness estimator, and we are releasing an implementation of the code that works with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, as well as an augmented maxBCG catalog with the {$\lambda$} richness measured for each cluster.},

  abstract = {Cluster weak lensing is a sensitive probe of cosmology, particularly the amplitude of matter clustering \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ and matter density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$. The main nuisance parameter in a cluster weak lensing cosmological analysis is the scatter between the true halo mass and the relevant cluster observable, denoted \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash ln Mc\}\$. We show that combining the cluster weak lensing observable \$\textbackslash Delta \textbackslash Sigma\$ with the projected cluster-galaxy cross-correlation function \$w\_\{p,cg\}\$ and galaxy auto-correlation function \$w\_\{p,gg\}\$ can break the degeneracy between \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$ and \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash ln Mc\}\$ to achieve tight, percent-level constraints on \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$. Using a grid of cosmological N-body simulations, we compute derivatives of \$\textbackslash Delta \textbackslash Sigma\$, \$w\_\{p,cg\}\$, and \$w\_\{p,gg\}\$ with respect to \$\textbackslash sigma\_8\$, \$\textbackslash Omega\_m\$, \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash ln Mc\}\$ and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters describing the galaxy population. We also compute covariance matrices motivated by the properties of the Dark Energy Suvery (DES) cluster and weak lensing survey and the BOSS CMASS galaxy redshift survey.

  abstract = {Galaxies and their dark-matter halos have posed several challenges to the Dark Energy plus Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmological model. These discrepancies between observations and theory intensify for the lowest-mass (`dwarf') galaxies. LCDM predictions for the number, spatial distribution, and internal structure of low-mass dark-matter halos have historically been at odds with observed dwarf galaxies, but this is partially expected, because many predictions modeled only the dark-matter component. Any robust LCDM prediction must include, hand-in-hand, a model for galaxy formation to understand how baryonic matter populates and affects dark-matter halos. In this article, we review the most notable challenges to LCDM regarding dwarf galaxies, and we discuss how recent cosmological numerical simulations have pinpointed baryonic solutions to these challenges. We identify remaining tensions, including the diversity of the inner dark-matter content, planes of satellites, stellar morphologies, and star-formation quenching. Their resolution, or validation as actual problems to LCDM, will likely require both refining galaxy formation models and improving numerical accuracy in simulations.},

We define early- and late-type subsamples, which are found to pass a series of systematics tests, including for spurious photometric redshift error and point spread function correlations. We analyse these split data alongside the fiducial mixed Y1 sample using a range of intrinsic alignment models. In a fiducial Nonlinear Alignment Model (NLA) analysis, assuming a flat \textbackslash lcdm\textasciitilde cosmology, we find a significant difference in intrinsic alignment amplitude, with early-type galaxies favouring \$A\_\textbackslash mathrm\{IA\} = 2.38\^\{+0.32\}\_\{-0.31\}\$ and late-type galaxies consistent with no intrinsic alignments at \$0.05\^\{+0.10\}\_\{-0.09\}\$. We find weak evidence of a diminishing alignment amplitude at higher redshifts in the early-type sample. The analysis is repeated using a number of extended model spaces, including a physically motivated model that includes both tidal torquing and tidal alignment mechanisms. In multiprobe likelihood chains in which cosmology, intrinsic alignments in both galaxy samples and all other relevant systematics are varied simultaneously, we find the tidal alignment and tidal torquing parts of the intrinsic alignment signal have amplitudes \$A\_1 = 2.66 \^\{+0.67\}\_\{-0.66\}\$, \$A\_2=-2.94\^\{+1.94\}\_\{-1.83\}\$, respectively, for early-type galaxies and \$A\_1 = 0.62 \^\{+0.41\}\_\{-0.41\}\$, \$A\_2 = -2.26\^\{+1.30\}\_\{-1.16\}\$ for late-type galaxies.

  abstract = {In Stage-IV imaging surveys, a significant amount of the cosmologically useful information is due to sources whose images overlap with those of other sources on the sky. The cosmic shear signal is primarily encoded in the estimated shapes of observed galaxies and thus directly impacted by overlaps. We introduce a framework based on the Fisher formalism to analyze effects of overlapping sources (blending) on the estimation of cosmic shear. For the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we present the expected loss in statistical sensitivity for the ten-year survey due to blending. We find that for approximately 62\% of galaxies that are likely to be detected in full-depth LSST images, at least 1\% of the flux in their pixels is from overlapping sources. We also find that the statistical correlations between measures of overlapping galaxies and, to a much lesser extent the higher shot noise level due to their presence, decrease the effective number density of galaxies, \$N\_\{eff\}\$, by \$\textbackslash sim\$18\%. We calculate an upper limit on \$N\_\{eff\}\$ of 39.4 galaxies per arcmin\$\^2\$ in \$r\$ band. We study the impact of varying stellar density on \$N\_\{eff\}\$ and illustrate the diminishing returns of extending the survey into lower Galactic latitudes. We extend the Fisher formalism to predict the increase in pixel-noise bias due to blending for maximum-likelihood (ML) shape estimators. We find that noise bias is sensitive to the particular shape estimator and measure of ensemble-average shape that is used, and properties of the galaxy that include redshift-dependent quantities such as size and luminosity.},

The SZE signature is measured using matched-filtered maps of the 2500 deg\$\^2\$ SPT-SZ survey at the positions of the DES clusters, and the degeneracy between SZE observable and matched-filter size is broken by adopting as priors SZE and optical mass-observable relations that are either calibrated using SPT selected clusters or through the Arnaud et al.

For clusters with \$\textbackslash lambda {$>$} 80\$, the two SPT calibrated scaling relations are consistent with the measurements, while for the A10-calibrated relation the measured SZE signal is smaller by a factor of \$0.61 \textbackslash pm 0.12\$ compared to the prediction.

  abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations for cosmology and galaxy cluster physics. To ensure the simulations are sufficiently realistic for studies of large-scale structure, the subgrid prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback are calibrated to the observed low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function and cluster gas fractions. The calibration is performed using machine learning, separately for each of FLAMINGO's three resolutions. This approach enables specification of the model by the observables to which they are calibrated. The calibration accounts for a number of potential observational biases and for random errors in the observed stellar masses. The two most demanding simulations have box sizes of 1.0 and 2.8 Gpc on a side and baryonic particle masses of 1 \texttimes{} 108 and 1 \texttimes{} 109 M{$\odot$}, respectively. For the latter resolution the suite includes 12 model variations in a 1 Gpc box. There are 8 variations at fixed cosmology, including shifts in the stellar mass function and/or the cluster gas fractions to which we calibrate, and two alternative implementations of AGN feedback (thermal or jets). The remaining 4 variations use the unmodified calibration data but different cosmologies, including different neutrino masses. The 2.8 Gpc simulation follows 3 \texttimes{} 1011 particles, making it the largest ever hydrodynamical simulation run to z = 0. Lightcone output is produced on-the-fly for up to 8 different observers. We investigate numerical convergence, show that the simulations reproduce the calibration data, and compare with a number of galaxy, cluster, and large-scale structure observations, finding very good agreement with the data for converged predictions. Finally, by comparing hydrodynamical and 'dark-matter-only' simulations, we confirm that baryonic effects can suppress the halo mass function and the matter power spectrum by up to {$\approx$}20 per cent.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic alignments (IA), correlations between the intrinsic shapes and orientations of galaxies on the sky, are both a significant systematic in weak lensing and a probe of the effect of large-scale structure on galactic structure and angular momentum. In the era of precision cosmology, it is thus especially important to model IA with high accuracy. Efforts to use cosmological perturbation theory to model the dependence of IA on the large-scale structure have thus far been relatively successful; however, extant models do not consistently account for time evolution. In particular, advection of galaxies due to peculiar velocities alters the impact of IA, because galaxy positions when observed are generally different from their positions at the epoch when IA is believed to be set. In this work, we evolve the galaxy IA from the time of galaxy formation to the time at which they are observed, including the effects of this advection, and show how this process naturally leads to a dependence of IA on the velocity shear. We calculate the galaxy-galaxy-IA bispectrum to tree level (in the linear matter density) in terms of the evolved IA coefficients. We then discuss the implications for weak lensing systematics as well as for studies of galaxy formation and evolution. We find that considering advection introduces nonlocality into the bispectrum, and that the degree of nonlocality represents the memory of a galaxy's path from the time of its formation to the time of observation. We discuss how this result can be used to constrain the redshift at which IA is determined and provide Fisher estimation for the relevant measurements using the example of SDSS-BOSS.},

  abstract = {We consider here a new statistical measure for cosmic shear, the aperture mass Map, which is defined as a spatially filtered projected density field and which can be measured directly from the image distortions of high-redshift galaxies. By selecting an appropriate spatial filter function, the dispersion of the aperture mass is a convolution of the power spectrum of the projected density field with a narrow kernel, so that {$<$}Map**2(theta){$>$} provides a well localized estimate of the power spectrum at wavenumbers s\textasciitilde 5/theta. We calculate {$<$}Map**2(theta){$>$} for various cosmological models, using the fully non-linear power spectrum of the cosmic density fluctuations. The non-linear evolution yields a significant increase of {$<$}Map**2{$>$} relative to the linear growth on scales below \textasciitilde 0.5 degree. The third-order moment of Map can be used to define a skewness, which is a measure of the non-Gaussianity of the density field. We present the first calculation of the skewness of the shear in the frame of quasi-linear theory of structure growth. We show that it yields a sensitive measure of the cosmological model; in particular, it is independent of the normalization of the power spectrum. Several practical estimates for {$<$}Map**2{$>$} are constructed and their dispersions calculated. We show that one sq.deg. of a high-quality image is sufficient to detect the cosmic shear with the Map-statistics on scales below \textasciitilde 10 arcmin, and to estimate its amplitude with an accuracy of \textasciitilde 30\% on scales below \textasciitilde 5 arcmin.

  abstract = {Cosmological simulations predict that galaxies are embedded into triaxial dark matter haloes, which appear approximately elliptical in projection. Weak gravitational lensing allows us to constrain these halo shapes and thereby test the nature of dark matter. Weak lensing has already provided robust detections of the signature of halo flattening at the mass scales of groups and clusters, whereas results for galaxies have been somewhat inconclusive. Here we combine data from five weak lensing surveys (NGVSLenS, KiDS/KV450, CFHTLenS, CS82, and RCSLenS, listed in order of most to least constraining) in order to tighten observational constraints on galaxy-scale halo ellipticity for photometrically selected lens samples. We constrain fh, the average ratio between the aligned component of the halo ellipticity and the ellipticity of the light distribution, finding fh = 0.303-0.079+0.080 for red lens galaxies and fh = 0.217-0.159+0.160 for blue lens galaxies when assuming elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White density profiles and a linear scaling between halo ellipticity and galaxy ellipticity. Our constraints for red galaxies constitute the currently most significant (3.8{$\sigma$}) systematics-corrected detection of the signature of halo flattening at the mass scale of galaxies. Our results are in good agreement with expectations from the Millennium Simulation that apply the same analysis scheme and incorporate models for galaxy-halo misalignment. Assuming these misalignment models and the analysis assumptions stated above are correct, our measurements imply an average dark matter halo ellipticity for the studied red galaxy samples of {$\langle$}|{$\epsilon$}h|{$\rangle$} = 0.174 {$\pm$} 0.046, where |{$\epsilon$}h| = (1 - q)/(1 + q) relates to the ratio q = b/a of the minor and major axes of the projected mass distribution. Similar measurements based on larger upcoming weak lensing data sets can help to calibrate models for intrinsic galaxy alignments, which constitute an important source of systematic uncertainty in cosmological weak lensing studies.},

Using the tomographic information and measuring also the second-order mass aperture, we additionally obtain a skewness parameter and its redshift evolution.

  abstract = {In a series of previous papers we have considered the reconstruction of the surface mass density of a cluster of galaxies from images of lensed faint background galaxies. We showed that the reconstructed surface mass density is not uniquely determined, but that there exists a global invariance transformation that leaves the shape of the images of the lensed galaxies unchanged. Because of this, only lower limits on the total mass of a cluster can be derived if no further information besides image ellipticities are used. Throughout these papers we used the simplifying assumption that all sources are at the same redshift. In this paper we account for a redshift distribution of the faint galaxies, and in particular, some of these galaxies can lie in front of the cluster or can be cluster members. We show how the mass distribution of a cluster of galaxies can be obtained from images of these faint galaxies, if the redshift distribution of these galaxies is known. We demonstrate that for the reconstruction of non-critical clusters we need less information on the redshift distribution of the galaxies, i.e., we only need to know two or three moments of the distribution. We show that the mean mass density across the data field is still a free variable, i.e., there remains a global invariance transformation of the resulting mass density field. For non-critical clusters we can derive the transformation explicitly and it is similar to that derived previously for the case of a single redshift of the sources. We discuss several theoretical ideas to break the mass degeneracy; of those considered, we find that only the magnification effect on the number density of galaxy images can be used successfully in practice.},

  abstract = {Metacalibration is a new technique for measuring weak gravitational lensing shear that is unbiased for isolated galaxy images. In this work we test metacalibration with overlapping, or ``blended'' galaxy images. Using standard metacalibration, we find a few percent shear measurement bias for galaxy densities relevant for current surveys, and that this bias increases with increasing galaxy number density. We show that this bias is not due to blending itself, but rather to shear-dependent object detection. If object detection is shear independent, no deblending of images is needed, in principle. We demonstrate that detection biases are accurately removed when including object detection in the metacalibration process, a technique we call metadetection. This process involves applying an artificial shear to images of small regions of sky and performing detection on the sheared images, as well as measurements that are used to calculate a shear response. We demonstrate that the method can accurately recover weak shear signals even in highly blended scenes. In the metacalibration process, the space between objects is sheared coherently, which does not perfectly match the real universe in which some, but not all, galaxy images are sheared coherently. We find that even for the worst case scenario, in which the space between objects is completely unsheared, the resulting shear bias is at most a few tenths of a percent for future surveys. We discuss additional technical challenges that must be met in order to implement metadetection for real surveys.},

  abstract = {Metacalibration is a recently introduced method to accurately measure weak gravitational lensing shear using only the available imaging data, without need for prior information about galaxy properties or calibration from simulations. The method involves distorting the image with a small known shear, and calculating the response of a shear estimator to that applied shear. The method was shown to be accurate in moderate-sized simulations with galaxy images that had relatively high signal-to-noise ratios, and without significant selection effects. In this work we introduce a formalism to correct for both shear response and selection biases. We also observe that for images with relatively low signal-to-noise ratios, the correlated noise that arises during the metacalibration process results in significant bias, for which we develop a simple empirical correction. To test this formalism, we created large image simulations based on both parametric models and real galaxy images, including tests with realistic point-spread functions. We varied the point-spread function ellipticity at the five-percent level. In each simulation we applied a small few-percent shear to the galaxy images. We introduced additional challenges that arise in real data, such as detection thresholds, stellar contamination, and missing data. We applied cuts on the measured galaxy properties to induce significant selection effects. Using our formalism, we recovered the input shear with an accuracy better than a part in a thousand in all cases.},

However, mis-identification of members due to projection effects from the large scale structure can occur. We studied the impact of projection effects on the measurement of the intrinsic alignment of galaxy clusters, using galaxy cluster mock catalogs. Our findings showed that projection effects result in a decrease of the large scale intrinsic alignment signal of the cluster and produce a bump at \$r\_p\textbackslash sim 1h\^\{-1\}/Mpc\$, most likely due to interlopers and missed member galaxies. This decrease in signal explains the observed similar alignment strength between bright central galaxies and clusters in the SDSS redMaPPer cluster catalog. The projection effect and cluster intrinsic alignment signal are coupled, with clusters having lower fractions of missing members or having higher fraction of interlopers exhibiting higher alignment signals in their projected shapes. We aim to use these findings to determine the impact of projection effects on galaxy cluster cosmology in future studies.},

We compare this ellipticity of the satellites to the halo shape, through a stacked lensing measurement using optimal estimators of the lensing quadrupole based on Clampitt and Jain (2016). We find a best-fit axis ratio of \$0.56 \textbackslash pm 0.09\$ (stat) \$\textbackslash pm 0.03\$ (sys), consistent with the ellipticity of the satellite distribution. Thus cluster galaxies trace the shape of the dark matter halo to within our estimated uncertainties. Finally, we restack the satellite and lensing ellipticity measurements along the major axis of the cluster central galaxy's light distribution. From the lensing measurements we infer a misalignment angle with an RMS of \$\{30\^\textbackslash circ \textbackslash pm 10\}\^\textbackslash circ\$ when stacking on the central galaxy.

Lifetimes of \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{25\}\$ sec are also excluded for the decaying TeV-scale DM. Finally, we apply this analysis to wino DM and exclude the wino mass around 200 GeV. These constraints will be further tightened, and all the interesting wino DM parameter region can be tested, by using data from future wide-field cosmology surveys.},

We have carefully characterized a broad range of systematic uncertainties, including shear calibration errors, photo-z biases, dilution by member galaxies, source obscuration, magnification bias, incorrect assumptions about cluster mass profiles, cluster centring, halo triaxiality and projection effects. We also compare measurements of the lensing signal from two independently produced shear and photometric redshift catalogues to characterize systematic errors in the lensing signal itself. Using a sample of 5570 clusters from 0.1 {$\leq$} z {$\leq$} 0.33, the normalization of our power-law mass versus {$\lambda$} relation is log10[M200m/h-1 M{$\odot$}] = 14.344 {$\pm$} 0.021 (statistical) {$\pm$}0.023 (systematic) at a richness {$\lambda$} = 40, a 7 per cent calibration uncertainty, with a power-law index of 1.33\^\{+0.09\}\_\{-0.10\} (1{$\sigma$}). The detailed systematics characterization in this work renders it the definitive weak lensing mass calibration for SDSS redMaPPer clusters at this time.},

  abstract = {The two-point correlation function (2PCF) is the most widely used tool for quantifying the spatial distribution of galaxies. Since the distribution of galaxies is determined by galaxy formation physics as well as the underlying cosmology, fitting an observed correlation function yields valuable insights into both. The calculation for a 2PCF involves computing pair-wise separations and consequently, the computing time-scales quadratically with the number of galaxies. The next-generation galaxy surveys are slated to observe many millions of galaxies, and computing the 2PCF for such surveys would be prohibitively time-consuming. Additionally, modern modelling techniques require the 2PCF to be calculated thousands of times on simulated galaxy catalogues of at least equal size to the data and would be completely unfeasible for the next-generation surveys. Thus, calculating the 2PCF forms a substantial bottleneck in improving our understanding of the fundamental physics of the Universe, and we need high-performance software to compute the correlation function. In this paper, we present CORRFUNC - a suite of highly optimized, OPENMP parallel clustering codes. The improved performance of CORRFUNC arises from both efficient algorithms as well as software design that suits the underlying hardware of modern CPUs. CORRFUNC can compute a wide range of 2D and 3D correlation functions in either simulation (Cartesian) space or on-sky coordinates. CORRFUNC runs efficiently in both single- and multithreaded modes and can compute a typical two-point projected correlation function [wp(rp)] for {$\sim$}1 million galaxies within a few seconds on a single thread. CORRFUNC is designed to be both user-friendly and fast and is publicly available at https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc.},

  abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semianalytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly cosmic high noon (z {$\sim$} 2\textendash 3) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence among different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multiscale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

For individual halos, our model approximates c(t) as a power law with a time-dependent index, such that at early times, concentration has a nearly constant value of c=3-4, and as cosmic time progresses, c(t) smoothly increases. Using large samples of halo merger trees taken from the Bolshoi-P and MDPL2 cosmological simulations, we demonstrate that our 3-parameter model can approximate the evolution of the concentration of individual halos with a typical accuracy of 0.1 dex for t{$>$}2 Gyr for all Bolshoi-P and MDPL2 halos of present-day mass greater than 10\^11.5 Msun. We additionally present a new model of the evolution of the concentration of halo populations, which we show faithfully reproduces both average concentration growth, as well as the diversity of smooth trajectories of c(t), including capturing correlations with halo mass and halo assembly history. Our publicly available source code, Diffprof, can be used to generate Monte Carlo realizations of the concentration histories of cosmologically representative halo populations; Diffprof is differentiable due to its implementation in the JAX autodiff library, which facilitates the incorporation of our model into existing analytical halo model frameworks.},

Using mock cluster catalogs built from cosmological N-body simulations, we quantify the impact of these projection effects with a particular focus on the observables of interest for cluster cosmology, namely the cluster lensing and the cluster clustering signals. We find that "observed" clusters, i.e. clusters identified by our cluster finder algorithm, exhibit lensing and clustering signals that deviate from expectations based on a statistically isotropic halo model -- while both signals agree with halo model expectations on small scales, they show unexpected boosts on large scales, by up to a factor of 1.2 or 1.4 respectively. We identify the origin of these boosts as the inherent selection bias of optical cluster finders for clusters embedded within filaments aligned with the line-of-sight, and show that a minority (\$\textbackslash sim 30\textbackslash\%\$) of such clusters within the entire sample is responsible for this observed boost. We discuss the implications of our results on previous studies of optical cluster, as well as prospects for identifying and mitigating projection effects in future cluster cosmology analyses.},

  abstract = {Optical clusters identified from red-sequence galaxies suffer from projection effects, where interloper galaxies along the line-of-sight to a cluster are mistaken as genuine members of the cluster. In the previous study (Sunayama et al. 2020), we found that the projection effects cause the boost on the amplitudes of clustering and lensing on large scale compared to the expected amplitudes in the absence of any projection effects. These boosts are caused by preferential selections of filamentary structure aligned to the line-of-sight due to distance uncertainties in photometric surveys. We model the projection effects with two simple assumptions and develop a novel method to quantify the size of the boost using cluster-galaxy cross-correlation functions. We validate our method using mock cluster catalogs built from cosmological N-body simulations and find that we can obtain unbiased constraints on the boost parameter with our model. We then apply our analysis on the SDSS redMaPPer clusters and find that the size of the boost is roughly 20\% for all the richness bins except the cluster sample with the richness bin \$\textbackslash lambda \textbackslash in [30,40]\$. This is the first study to constrain the boost parameter independent from cluster cosmology studies and provides a self-consistency test for the projection effects.},

  abstract = {A new N-body and hydrodynamical code, called RAMSES, is presented. It has been designed to study structure formation in the universe with high spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree-based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code \textbackslash citep\{kravtsov97\}, with minor differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious effects associated with shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low density Lambda CDM universe are reported, with 256\textsuperscript{3} particles and 4.1x 10\textsuperscript{7} cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 8192\textsuperscript{3}. A convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloe temperature profiles, shows that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the framework of the halo model.},

The survey data will allow us to measure the dark energy and dark matter densities and the dark energy equation of state through four independent methods: galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing tomography, galaxy angular clustering, and supernova distances. These methods are doubly complementary: they constrain different combinations of cosmological model parameters and are subject to different systematic errors. By deriving the four sets of measurements from the same data set with a common analysis framework, we will obtain important cross checks of the systematic errors and thereby make a substantial and robust advance in the precision of dark energy measurements.},

  abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat LCDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at z{$<\sptilde$}2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range 10\^\{11\} Msol/h {$<$} M {$<$} 10\^\{15\} Msol/h, to {$<\sptilde$} 5\%. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z=0 and earlier epochs. In addition to these formulae, which improve on previous approximations by 10-20\%, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal fitting function at this level of accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by \textasciitilde 20-50\%, depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

These catalogs are based on a one-quarter sky simulation populated with galaxies out to a redshift of \$z=2.35\$ to a depth of \$m\_\{\textbackslash rm\{r\}\}=27\$. Compared to the Buzzard mocks, the Cardinal mocks include an updated subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) model that considers orphan galaxies and includes mass-dependent scatter between galaxy luminosity and halo properties. This model can simultaneously fit galaxy clustering and group--galaxy cross-correlations measured in three different luminosity threshold samples. The Cardinal mocks also feature a new color assignment model that can simultaneously fit color-dependent galaxy clustering in three different luminosity bins. We have developed an algorithm that uses photometric data to improve the color assignment model further and have also developed a novel method to improve small-scale lensing below the ray-tracing resolution. These improvements enable the Cardinal mocks to accurately reproduce the abundance of galaxy clusters and the properties of lens galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey data. As such, these simulations will be a valuable tool for future cosmological analyses based on large sky surveys. The cardinal mock will be released upon publication at https://chunhaoto.com/cardinalsim.},

In this letter, we present the first joint analysis of cluster abundances and auto/cross correlations of three cosmic tracer fields measured from the first year data of the Dark Energy Survey: galaxy density, weak gravitational lensing shear, and cluster density split by optical richness. From a joint analysis of cluster abundances, three cluster cross-correlations, and auto correlations of galaxy density, we obtain \$\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm\{m\}\}=0.305\^\{+0.055\}\_\{-0.038\}\$ and \$\textbackslash sigma\_8=0.783\^\{+0.064\}\_\{-0.054\}\$. This result is consistent with constraints from the DES-Y1 galaxy clustering and weak lensing two-point correlation functions for the flat \$\textbackslash nu\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. We thus combine cluster abundances and all two-point correlations from three cosmic tracer fields and find improved constraints on cosmological parameters as well as on the cluster observable--mass scaling relation. This analysis is an important advance in both optical cluster cosmology and multi-probe analyses of upcoming wide imaging surveys.},

With relensing we extent the amount of software available, which provides the scientific community with a wide range of models that help to compare and therefore validate the physical results that rely on them. We implement a free-form approach which computes the gravitational deflection potential on a adaptive irregular grid, from which one can characterize the cluster and its properties as a gravitational lens. Here, we use two alternative penalty functions to constrain strong lensing. We apply relensing to two toy models, in order to explore under which conditions one can get a better performance in the reconstruction. We find that by applying a smoothing to the deflection potential enhances the capability of this approach to recover the shape and size of the galaxy cluster's mass profile, as well as its magnification map, which translates in a better estimation of the critical and caustic curves. The power that the smoothing provides is also tested on the simulated clusters Ares and Hera, for which our results represent an improvement with respect to reconstructions that were carried out with methods of the same nature than relensing. At the same time, the smoothing also increases the stability of our implementation, and decreases the computation time. On its current state, relensing is available upon request.},

These clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate, were identified in 178 deg\^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the South Pole Telescope to a depth of 18 uK-arcmin at 150 GHz. Optical imaging from the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) and Magellan telescopes provided photometric (and in some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts ranging from z=0.15 to z{$>$}1, with a median z = 0.74. Of the 21 confirmed galaxy clusters, three were previously identified as Abell clusters, three were presented as SPT discoveries in Staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were first identified in a recent analysis of BCS data by Menanteau et al, 2010; the remaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. Simulated observations of the SPT fields predict the sample to be nearly 100\% complete above a mass threshold of M\_200 \textasciitilde{} 5x10\^14 M\_sun/h at z = 0.6. This completeness threshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to \textasciitilde 4x10\^14 M\_sun/h at z=1. The size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in good agreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxy clusters and cosmology. In combination with other cosmological probes, we use the cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. Assuming a standard spatially flat wCDM cosmological model, the addition of our catalog to the WMAP 7-year analysis yields sigma\_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a \textasciitilde 50\% improvement in precision on both parameters over WMAP7 alone.},

We generate mock images with the properties of the CANDELS survey and derive Sersic parameters and optical rest-frame morphologies as usually done in the observations. Overall, the simulation reproduces the observed evolution of the abundances of different galaxy morphological types of star-forming and quiescent galaxies. The log M* - log Re and log M* - log {$\Sigma$}1 relations of the simulated star-forming and quenched galaxies also match the observed slopes and zeropoints to within 1-{$\sigma$}. In the simulation, galaxies increase their observed central stellar mass density ({$\Sigma$}1) and transform in morphology from irregular/clumpy systems to normal Hubble-type systems in the star formation main sequence at a characteristic stellar mass of \textasciitilde 1010.5 M{$\odot$} which is reflected in an increase of the central stellar mass density ({$\Sigma$}1). This morphological transformation is connected to the activity of the central super massive black holes (SMBHs). At low stellar masses (109 {$<$} M*/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 1010) SMBHs grow rapidly, while at higher mass SMBHs switch into the kinetic feedback mode and grow more slowly. During this low-accretion phase, SMBH feedback leads to the quenching of star-formation, along with a simultaneous growth in {$\Sigma$}1, partly due to the fading of stellar populations. More compact massive galaxies grow their SMBHs faster than extended ones of the same mass and end up quenching earlier. In the TNG50 simulation, SMBHs predominantly grow via gas accretion before galaxies quench, and {$\Sigma$}1 increases substantially after SMBH growth slows down. The simulation predicts therefore that quiescent galaxies have higher {$\Sigma$}1 values than star-forming galaxies for the same SMBH mass, which disagrees with alternative models, and may potentially be in tension with some observations.},

These simulations follow the non-linear evolution of galaxies modeling a variety of physical processes over an enormous range of scales. A better understanding of the physics relevant for shaping galaxies, improved numerical methods, and increased computing power have led to simulations that can reproduce a large number of observed galaxy properties. Modern simulations model dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter in an expanding space-time starting from well-defined initial conditions. The modeling of ordinary matter is most challenging due to the large array of physical processes affecting this matter component. Cosmological simulations have also proven useful to study alternative cosmological models and their impact on the galaxy population. This review presents a concise overview of the methodology of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and their different applications.},

The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10\^12 Msun, less than 20\% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},

  abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of ``dark energy'' with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein's theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit ``Stage IV'' dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

  abstract = {We measure the velocity dispersions of clusters of galaxies selected by the redMaPPer algorithm in the first three years of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), allowing us to probe cluster selection and richness estimation, \$\textbackslash lambda\$, in light of cluster dynamics. Our sample consists of 126 clusters with sufficient spectroscopy for individual velocity dispersion estimates. We examine the correlations between cluster velocity dispersion, richness, X-ray temperature and luminosity as well as central galaxy velocity offsets. The velocity dispersion-richness relation exhibits a bimodal distribution. The majority of clusters follow scaling relations between velocity dispersion, richness, and X-ray properties similar to those found for previous samples; however, there is a significant population of clusters with velocity dispersions which are high for their richness. These clusters account for roughly 20\textbackslash\% of the \$\textbackslash lambda {$<$} 70\$ systems in our sample, but more than half of \$\textbackslash lambda {$<$} 70\$ clusters at \$z{$>$}0.5\$. A couple of these systems are hot and X-ray bright as expected for massive clusters with richnesses that appear to have been underestimated, but most appear to have high velocity dispersions for their X-ray properties likely due to line-of-sight structure. These results suggest that projection effects contribute significantly to redMaPPer selection, particularly at higher redshifts and lower richnesses. The redMaPPer determined richnesses for the velocity dispersion outliers are consistent with their X-ray properties, but several are X-ray undetected and deeper data is needed to understand their nature.},

  abstract = {Advances in observational capabilities have ushered in a new era of multi-wavelength, multi-physics probes of galaxy clusters and ambitious surveys are compiling large samples of cluster candidates selected in different ways. We use a high-resolution N-body simulation to study how the influence of large-scale structure in and around clusters causes correlated signals in different physical probes and discuss some implications this has for multi-physics probes of clusters (e.g. richness, lensing, Compton distortion and velocity dispersion). We pay particular attention to velocity dispersions, matching galaxies to subhaloes which are explicitly tracked in the simulation. We find that not only do haloes persist as subhaloes when they fall into a larger host, but groups of subhaloes retain their identity for long periods within larger host haloes. The highly anisotropic nature of infall into massive clusters, and their triaxiality, translates into an anisotropic velocity ellipsoid: line-of-sight galaxy velocity dispersions for any individual halo show large variance depending on viewing angle. The orientation of the velocity ellipsoid is correlated with the large-scale structure, and thus velocity outliers correlate with outliers caused by projection in other probes. We quantify this orientation uncertainty and give illustrative examples. Such a large variance suggests that velocity dispersion estimators will work better in an ensemble sense than for any individual cluster, which may inform strategies for obtaining redshifts of cluster members. We similarly find that the ability of substructure indicators to find kinematic substructures is highly viewing angle dependent. While groups of subhaloes which merge with a larger host halo can retain their identity for many Gyr, they are only sporadically picked up by substructure indicators. We discuss the effects of correlated scatter on scaling relations estimated through stacking, both analytically and in the simulations, showing that the strong correlation of measures with mass and the large scatter in mass at fixed observable mitigate line-of-sight projections.},

  abstract = {A model of galaxy formation is developed in which dissipation plays a role along with purely gravitational processes. The gist of the model is that the distribution of the dominant mass component on all scales arises from purely gravitational clustering, while the observed sizes and luminosity functions of galaxies are determined by gas-dynamical dissipative processes. The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies. On certain specific assumptions, a luminosity function is derived that agrees reasonably well with observation.},

We advocate an approach, analogous to galaxy-galaxy lensing, in which the observables in each redshift bin are the mean number counts and the mean weak lensing profile of clusters above a mass proxy threshold. The primary astrophysical nuisance parameter is the logarithmic scatter between the mass proxy and true mass near the threshold. For surveys similar to the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Roman Space Telescope High Latitude Survey (HLS), and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we forecast aggregate precision on sigma\_8 of 0.26\%, 0.24\%, and 0.10\%, respectively, if the mass-observable scatter has an external prior better than 0.01. These constraints would be degraded by about 20\% for a 0.05 prior on scatter in the case of DES or HLS and for a 0.016 prior for LSST. A one-month observing program with Roman Space Telescope targeting approximately 2500 massive clusters could achieve a 0.5\% constraint on sigma\_8(z=0.7) on its own, or a \textasciitilde 0.33\% constraint in combination with the HLS. Realizing the constraining power of clusters requires accurate knowledge of the mass-observable relation and stringent control of systematics. We provide analytic approximations to our numerical results that allow easy scaling to other survey assumptions or other methods of cluster mass estimation.},

In these experiments, accurate modelling of covariance matrices of cluster weak lensing plays the key role in obtaining robust measurements of the mean mass of clusters and cosmological parameters. We use a combination of analytical calculations and high-resolution N-body simulations to derive accurate covariance matrices that span from the virial regime to linear scales of the cluster-matter cross-correlation. We validate this calculation using a public ray-tracing lensing simulation and provide a software package for calculating covariance matrices for a wide range of cluster and source sample choices. We discuss the relative importance of shape noise and density fluctuations, the impact of radial bin size, and the impact of off-diagonal elements. For a weak lensing source density 10 per square arcmin, shape noise typically dominates the variance on comoving scales less than 5 Mpc/h. However, for 60 per square arcmin, potentially achievable with future weak lensing experiments, density fluctuations typically dominate the variance at scales greater than 1 Mpc/h and remain comparable to shape noise on smaller scales.},

  abstract = {Cosmological constraints from current and upcoming galaxy cluster surveys are limited by the accuracy of cluster mass calibration. In particular, optically identified galaxy clusters are prone to selection effects that can bias the weak lensing mass calibration. We investigate the selection bias of the stacked cluster lensing signal associated with optically selected clusters, using clusters identified by the redMaPPer algorithm in the Buzzard simulations as a case study. We find that at a given cluster halo mass, the residuals of redMaPPer richness and weak lensing signal are positively correlated. As a result, for a given richness selection, the stacked lensing signal is biased high compared with what we would expect from the underlying halo mass probability distribution. The cluster lensing selection bias can thus lead to overestimated mean cluster mass and biased cosmology results. We show that the lensing selection bias exhibits a strong scale dependence and is approximately 20\textendash 60~per~cent for {$\Delta\Sigma$} at large scales. This selection bias largely originates from spurious member galaxies within {$\pm$}20\textendash 60~\$h\^\{-1\}\textbackslash, \textbackslash rm Mpc\$ along the line of sight, highlighting the importance of quantifying projection effects associated with the broad redshift distribution of member galaxies in photometric cluster surveys. While our results qualitatively agree with those in the literature, accurate quantitative modelling of the selection bias is needed to achieve the goals of cluster lensing cosmology and will require synthetic catalogues covering a wide range of galaxy\textendash halo connection models.},

Galaxies were selected to be more massive than 10\^10 Msun and have specific star formation rates above 1/t\_H. We model the 7-band optical ACS + near-IR WFC3 spectral energy distributions of individual bins of pixels, accounting simultaneously for the galaxy-integrated photometric constraints available over a longer wavelength range. We analyze variations in rest-frame color, stellar surface mass density, age, and extinction as a function of galactocentric radius and local surface brightness/density, and measure structural parameters on luminosity and stellar mass maps. We find evidence for redder colors, older stellar ages, and increased dust extinction in the nuclei of galaxies. Big star-forming clumps seen in star formation tracers are less prominent or even invisible on the inferred stellar mass distributions. Off-center clumps contribute up to \textasciitilde 20\% to the integrated SFR, but only 7\% or less to the integrated mass of all massive star-forming galaxies at z \textasciitilde{} 1 and z \textasciitilde{} 2, with the fractional contributions being a decreasing function of wavelength used to select the clumps. The stellar mass profiles tend to have smaller sizes and M20 coefficients, and higher concentration and Gini coefficients than the light distribution. Our results are consistent with an inside-out disk growth scenario with brief (100 - 200 Myr) episodic local enhancements in star formation superposed on the underlying disk. Alternatively, the young ages of off-center clumps may signal inward clump migration, provided this happens efficiently on the order of an orbital timescale.},

  abstract = {We propose that observations of super-massive galaxies contain cosmological constraining power similar to conventional cluster cosmology, and we provide promising indications that the associated systematic errors are comparably easier to control. We consider a fiducial spectroscopic and stellar mass complete sample of galaxies drawn from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI) and forecast how constraints on Omega\_m-sigma\_8 from this sample will compare with those from number counts of clusters based on richness. At fixed number density, we find that massive galaxies offer similar constraints to galaxy clusters. However, a mass-complete galaxy sample from DESI has the potential to probe lower halo masses than standard optical cluster samples (which are typically limited to richness above 20 and halo mass above 10\^13.5); additionally, it is straightforward to cleanly measure projected galaxy clustering for such a DESI sample, which we show can substantially improve the constraining power on Omega\_m. We also compare the constraining power of stellar mass-limited samples to those from larger but mass-incomplete samples (e.g., the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey, BGS, Sample); relative to a lower number density stellar mass-limited samples, we find that a BGS-like sample improves statistical constraints by 60\% for Omega\_m and 40\% for sigma\_8, but this uses small scale information which will be harder to model for BGS. Our initial assessment of the systematics associated with supermassive galaxy cosmology yields promising results. The proposed samples have a 10\% satellite fraction, but we show that cosmological constraints may be robust to the impact of satellites. These findings motivate future work to realize the potential of super-massive galaxies to probe lower halo masses than richness-based clusters and to avoid persistent systematics associated with optical cluster finding.},

In this paper, we use simulations to study the precision and accuracy to which we can detect the splashback radius with 3D density, 3D subhalo, and weak lensing profiles. We study how well various methods and tracers recover \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm sp\}\$ by comparing it with the value measured directly from particle dynamics. We show that estimates of \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm sp\}\$ from density and subhalo profiles correspond to different percentiles of the underlying \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm sp\}\$ distribution of particle orbits. At low accretion rates, a second caustic appears and can bias results. Finally, we show that upcoming lensing surveys may be able to constrain the splashback-accretion rate relation directly.},

In this paper, we study the impact of secondary halo properties on the galaxy-galaxy lensing observable, {$\Delta\Sigma$}. We build an emulator trained on N-body simulations to model {$\Delta\Sigma$} and quantify the impact of different secondary parameters on the {$\Delta\Sigma$} profile. We focus on the impact of MAR on {$\Delta\Sigma$}. We show that a 3{$\sigma$} detection of variations in MAR at fixed halo mass could be achieved with the Hyper Suprime Cam survey assuming no baryonic effects and a proxy for MAR with scatter \&lt;1.5. We show that the full radial profile of {$\Delta\Sigma$} depends on secondary properties at fixed halo mass. Consequently, an emulator that can perform full shape fitting yields better than two~times improvement upon the constraints on MAR than only using the outer part of the halo. Finally, we highlight that miscentring and MAR impact the radial profile of {$\Delta\Sigma$} in a similar fashion, implying that miscentring and MAR need to be modelled jointly for unbiased estimates of both effects. We show that present-day lensing data sets have the statistical capability to place constraints on halo MAR within our assumptions. Our analysis opens up new possibilities for observationally measuring the assembly history of the dark matter haloes that host galaxies and clusters.},

  abstract = {Galaxy clusters enable unique opportunities to study cosmology, dark matter, galaxy evolution, and strongly-lensed transients. We here present a new cluster-finding algorithm, CluMPR (Clusters from Masses and Photometric Redshifts), that exploits photometric redshifts (photo-z's) as well as photometric stellar mass measurements. CluMPR uses a 2-dimensional binary search tree to search for overdensities of massive galaxies with similar redshifts on the sky and then probabilistically assigns cluster membership by accounting for photo-z uncertainties. We leverage the deep DESI Legacy Surveys grzW1W2 imaging over one-third of the sky to create a catalogue of \textasciitilde{} 300,000 galaxy cluster candidates out to z = 1, including tabulations of member galaxies and estimates of each cluster's total stellar mass. Compared to other methods, CluMPR is particularly effective at identifying clusters at the high end of the redshift range considered (z = 0.75-1), with minimal contamination from low-mass groups. These characteristics make it ideal for identifying strongly lensed high-redshift supernovae and quasars that are powerful probes of cosmology, dark matter, and stellar astrophysics. As an example application of this cluster catalogue, we present a catalogue of candidate wide-angle strongly-lensed quasars in Appendix C. The five best candidates identified from this sample include two known lensed quasar systems and a possible changing-look lensed QSO with SDSS spectroscopy. All code and catalogues produced in this work are publicly available (see Data Availability).},

In this work, we explore the possibility of combining three correlation functions - cluster lensing, the cluster-galaxy cross-correlation function, and the galaxy autocorrelation function - to self-calibrate optical cluster selection bias, the boosted clustering and lensing signals in a richness-selected sample mainly caused by projection effects. We develop mock catalogues of redMaGiC-like galaxies and redMaPPer-like clusters by applying halo occupation distribution models to N-body simulations and using counts-in-cylinders around massive haloes as a richness proxy. In addition to the previously known small-scale boost in projected correlation functions, we find that the projection effects also significantly boost three-dimensional correlation functions to scales of 100 \$h\^\{-1\} \textbackslash, \textbackslash rm Mpc\$. We perform a likelihood analysis assuming survey conditions similar to the Dark Energy Survey and show that the selection bias can be self-consistently constrained at the 10 per cent level. We discuss strategies for applying this approach to real data. We expect that expanding the analysis to smaller scales and using deeper lensing data would further improve the constraints on cluster selection bias.},

The methods allow us to acquire high signal-to-noise measurements of the ICL and central galaxies (CGs), which we separate with radial cuts. The ICL appears as faint and diffuse light extending to at least 1 Mpc from the cluster center, reaching a surface brightness level of 30 mag arcsec\$\^\{-2\}\$. The ICL and the cluster CG contribute to \$44\textbackslash\%\textbackslash pm17\$\textbackslash\% of the total cluster stellar luminosity within 1 Mpc. The ICL color is overall consistent with that of the cluster red sequence galaxies, but displays the trend of becoming bluer with increasing radius. The ICL demonstrates an interesting self-similarity feature -- for clusters in different richness ranges, their ICL radial profiles are similar after scaling with cluster \$R\_\textbackslash mathrm\{200m\}\$, and the ICL brightness appears to be a good tracer of the cluster radial mass distribution. These analyses are based on the DES redMaPPer cluster sample identified in the first year of observations.},

  abstract = {We introduce deep-field metacalibration, a new technique that reduces the pixel noise in metacalibration estimators of weak lensing shear signals by using a deeper imaging survey for calibration. In standard metacalibration, when estimating the object's shear response, extra noise is added to correct the effect of shearing the noise in the image, increasing the uncertainty on shear estimates by \textasciitilde{} 20\%. Our new deep-field metacalibration technique leverages a separate, deeper imaging survey to calculate calibrations with less degradation in image noise. We demonstrate that weak lensing shear measurement with deep-field metacalibration is unbiased up to second-order shear effects. We provide algorithms to apply this technique to imaging surveys and describe how to generalize it to shear estimators that rely explicitly on object detection (e.g., metacalibration). For the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the improvement in weak lensing precision will depend on the somewhat unknown details of the LSST Deep Drilling Field (DDF) observations in terms of area and depth, the relative point-spread function properties of the DDF and main LSST surveys, and the relative contribution of pixel noise vs. intrinsic shape noise to the total shape noise in the survey. We conservatively estimate that the degradation in precision is reduced from 20\% for metacalibration to \textasciitilde{} 5\% or less for deep-field metacalibration, which we attribute primarily to the increased source density and reduced pixel noise contributions to the overall shape noise. Finally, we show that the technique is robust to sample variance in the LSST DDFs due to their large area, with the equivalent calibration error being \textasciitilde{} 0.1\%. The deep-field metacalibration technique provides higher signal-to-noise weak lensing measurements while still meeting the stringent systematic error requirements of future surveys.},

In this letter, we use the Illustris-TNG simulation to demonstrate that selecting on galaxy counts induces a selection effect because of projection and correlation between different observables. We compute the weak-lensing-like projected mass estimations of dark matter haloes and examine their projected subhalo counts. In the two-dimensional (2D) projected space, haloes that are measured as more massive than truth have higher subhalo counts. Thus, projection along the line of sight creates cluster observables that are correlated with cluster mass measurement deviations, which in turn creates a mass measurement bias when the clusters are selected by this correlated observable. We demonstrate that the bias is predicted in a forward model using the observable-mass measurement correlation.},

  abstract = {Counts of galaxy clusters offer a high-precision probe of cosmology, but control of systematic errors will determine the accuracy of this measurement. Using Buzzard simulations, we quantify one such systematic, the triaxiality distribution of clusters identified with the redMaPPer optical cluster finding algorithm, which was used in the Dark Energy Survey Year-1 (DES Y1) cluster cosmology analysis. We test whether redMaPPer selection biases the clusters' shape and orientation and find that it only biases orientation, preferentially selecting clusters with their major axes oriented along the line of sight. Modelling the richness-mass relation as log-linear, we find that the log-richness amplitude ln (A) is boosted from the lowest to highest orientation bin with a significance of 14{$\sigma$}, while the orientation dependence of the richness-mass slope and intrinsic scatter is minimal. We also find that the weak lensing shear-profile ratios of cluster-associated dark haloes in different orientation bins resemble a 'bottleneck' shape that can be quantified with a Cauchy function. We test the correlation of orientation with two other leading systematics in cluster cosmology - miscentering and projection - and find a null correlation. The resulting mass bias predicted from our templates confirms the DES Y1 finding that triaxiality is a leading source of bias in cluster cosmology. However, the richness-dependence of the bias confirms that triaxiality does not fully resolve the tension at low-richness between DES Y1 cluster cosmology and other probes. Our model can be used for quantifying the impact of triaxiality bias on cosmological constraints for upcoming weak lensing surveys of galaxy clusters.},

  abstract = {Clusters of galaxies are sensitive to the most nonlinear peaks in the cosmic density field. The weak gravitational lensing of background galaxies by clusters can allow us to infer their masses. However, galaxies associated with the local environment of the cluster can also be intrinsically aligned due to the local tidal gradient, contaminating any cosmology derived from the lensing signal. We measure this intrinsic alignment in Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 redMaPPer clusters. We find evidence of a non-zero mean radial alignment of galaxies within clusters between redshift 0.1-0.7. We find a significant systematic in the measured ellipticities of cluster satellite galaxies that we attribute to the central galaxy flux and other intracluster light. We attempt to correct this signal, and fit a simple model for intrinsic alignment amplitude (\$A\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{IA\}\}\$) to the measurement, finding \$A\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{IA\}\}=0.15\textbackslash pm 0.04\$, when excluding data near the edge of the cluster. We find a significantly stronger alignment of the central galaxy with the cluster dark matter halo at low redshift and with higher richness and central galaxy absolute magnitude (proxies for cluster mass). This is an important demonstration of the ability of large photometric data sets like DES to provide direct constraints on the intrinsic alignment of galaxies within clusters. These measurements can inform improvements to small-scale modeling and simulation of the intrinsic alignment of galaxies to help improve the separation of the intrinsic alignment signal in weak lensing studies.},

  abstract = {Recently, several studies have discovered a strong discrepancy between the large-scale clustering biases of two subsamples of galaxy clusters at the same halo mass, split by their average projected membership distances \$R\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{mem\}\}\$. The level of this discrepancy significantly exceeds the maximum halo assembly bias signal predicted by LCDM. In this study, we explore whether some of the clustering bias differences could be caused by biases in \$R\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{mem\}\}\$ due to projection effects from other systems along the line-of-sight. We thoroughly investigate the halo assembly bias of the photometrically-detected redMaPPer clusters in SDSS, by defining a new variant of the average membership distance estimator \$\textbackslash tilde\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{mem\}\}\$ that is more robust against projection effects in the cluster membership identification. Using the angular mark correlation functions of clusters, we show that the large-scale bias differences when splitting by \$R\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{mem\}\}\$ can be largely attributed to such projection effects. After splitting by \$\textbackslash tilde\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{mem\}\}\$, the anomalously large signal is reduced, giving a ratio of \$1.02\textbackslash pm0.14\$ between the two clustering biases as measured from weak lensing. Using a realistic mock cluster catalog, we predict that the bias ratio between two \$\textbackslash tilde\{R\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{mem\}\}\$-split subsamples should be \${$<$}1.10\$, which is at least 60\% weaker than the maximum halo assembly bias signal (1.24) when split by halo concentration. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the level of halo assembly bias exhibited by redMaPPer clusters in SDSS is consistent with the LCDM prediction. With a ten-fold increase in cluster numbers, deeper ongoing surveys will enable a more robust detection of halo assembly bias. Our findings also have important implications for how projection effects and their impact on cluster cosmology can be quantified in photometric cluster catalogs.},
